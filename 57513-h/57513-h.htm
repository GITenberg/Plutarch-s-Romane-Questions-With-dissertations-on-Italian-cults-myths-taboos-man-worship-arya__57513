  class="larger">PREFACE.</span></h3>

  <p>On the whole, with the proper qualifications, Plutarch's <i>Romane Questions</i> may fairly be
  said to be the earliest formal treatise written on the subject of folk-lore. The problems which
  Plutarch proposes for solution are mainly such as the modern science of folk-lore undertakes to
  solve; and though Plutarch was not the first to propound them, he was the first to make a
  collection and selection of them and give them a place of their own in literature. On the other
  hand, though Plutarch's questions are in the spirit of modern scientific inquiry, his
  answers&mdash;or rather the answers which he sets forth, for they are not always or usually his
  own&mdash;are conceived in a different strain. They are all built on the assumption that the
  customs which they are intended to explain were consciously and deliberately instituted by men who
  possessed at least as much culture <span class="pagenum" id="pagevi">{vi}</span>and wisdom as
  Plutarch himself, or the other philosophers who busied themselves with this branch of antiquities.
  This assumption, however, that the primitive Italians or the pro-ethnic Aryans shared the same
  (erroneous) scientific and philosophical views as the savants of Plutarch's day, is an unverified
  and improbable hypothesis. The Aryans were in the Stone Age, and had advanced only to such
  rudimentary agriculture as is possible for a nomad people. If, therefore, we are to explain their
  customs, we must keep within the narrow circle which bounds the thought and imagination of other
  peoples in the same stage of development. Plutarch, however, in effect asks himself, "If I had
  instituted these customs, what would my motives have been?" and in reply to his own question he
  shows what very learned reasons might have moved him; and also, quite unconsciously, what very
  amiable feelings would in reality have governed him; for, if he ascribes to the authors of these
  customs the learning of all the many books which he had read, he also credits them with a
  kindliness of character which belonged to himself alone. Thus, to go no further than <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagevii">{vii}</span>the first of the <i>Romane Questions</i>, viz., <i>What
  is the reason that new-wedded wives are bidden to touch fire and water?</i> Plutarch first gives
  four high philosophical reasons, which he may have borrowed, but concludes with one which we may
  be sure is his own: "Or last of all [is it] because man and wife ought not to forsake and abandon
  one another, but to take part of all fortunes; though they had no other good in the world common
  between them, but fire and water only?"</p>

  <p>That this, like the rest of Plutarch's reasons, is fanciful, may not be denied, but would not
  be worth mentioning, were it not that here we have, implicit, the reason why no modern translation
  could ever vie with Philemon Holland's version of the <i>Romane Questions</i>. It is not merely
  because Philemon's antiquated English harmonises with Plutarch's antiquated speculation, and by
  that harmony disposes the reader's mind favourably towards it; but in Philemon's day, England,
  like the other countries of Western Europe, was discovering that all that is worth knowing is in
  Greek. The universal respect felt for Greek in those days, even by schoolmasters (Holland was
  himself <span class="pagenum" id="pageviii">{viii}</span>Head-master of Coventry Free School), is
  still apparent to those who read this translation. But things are now so changed that the English
  language of to-day cannot provide a seemly garb for Plutarch's ancient reasonings. To say in
  modern English that "five is the odd number most connected with marriage," is to expose the
  Pythagorean doctrine of numbers to modern ridicule. But when Philemon says, "Now among al odde
  numbers it seemeth that Cinque is most nuptial," even the irreverent modern cannot fail to feel
  that Cinque was an eminently respectable character, whose views were strictly honourable and a
  bright example to other odde numbers. Again, Philemon's insertion of the words "it seemeth" makes
  for reverence. The insertion is not apologetic; nor does it intimate that the translator hesitates
  to subscribe to so strange a statement. Rather, it summons the reader to give closer attention to
  the words which are about to follow&mdash;words of wisdom such as is to be found nowhere else but
  only in the fountain of all knowledge, Greek. Insertions and amplifications are indeed
  characteristic of Philemon as a translator. But, though his style is florid, it is lucid; his
  amplifications <span class="pagenum" id="pageix">{ix}</span>make the meaning clearer to the
  English reader, and, as a rule, only state explicitly what is really implied in the original.
  Sometimes (<i>e.g.</i>, towards the end of <i>R. Q.</i> 6) he does enlarge on the text beyond all
  measure; sometimes, again, defective scholarship leads him to ascribe things to Plutarch which
  Plutarch never said (<i>e.g.</i>, in <i>R. Q.</i> 5, <span
  title="tauta tropon tina tois Hellênikois
  eoiken" class="fsn">&tau;&alpha;&#x1FE6;&tau;&alpha; &tau;&rho;&#x1F79;&pi;&omicron;&nu;
  &tau;&iota;&nu;&#x1F70; &tau;&omicron;&#x1FD6;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F19;&lambda;&lambda;&eta;&nu;&iota;&kappa;&omicron;&iota;&sigmaf;
  &#x1F14;&omicron;&iota;&kappa;&epsilon;&nu;</span> does not mean "this may seeme in some sort to
  have beene derived from the Greeks"); and sometimes he is mistaken as to the meaning of a word
  (<i>e.g.</i>, <span title="enochos" class="fsn">&#x1F14;&nu;&omicron;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>
  in <i>R. Q.</i> 5). On the other hand, where the text is corrupt, he sees and says what the
  meaning really is; and Hearne's verdict that Holland had "an admirable knack in translating books"
  does not go beyond the mark. Indeed, it does not do justice to Philemon, for it hardly prepares us
  to learn that, in the infancy of the study of Greek in England, Philemon threw off, among other
  trifles, translations of all the <i>Moralia</i> of Plutarch, the whole of Livy, the enormous
  <i>Natural History</i> of Pliny, Suetonius, Ammianus Marcellinus, the <i>Cyropædia</i> of
  Xenophon, and Camden's <i>Britannia</i>. Southey is more just to the assiduous labours of a life
  of study carried to the age of eighty-five, when he <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagex">{x}</span>calls Philemon "the best of the Hollands." But the most discerning criticism
  of Holland, as "translator generall in his age" (Fuller), is contained in Owen's epigram on
  Holland's translation of the <i>Natural History</i>, that he was both <i>plenior</i> and
  <i>planior</i> than Plinius.</p>

  <p>To judge from the <i>Romane Questions</i>, Philemon must have used as his text the edition of
  1560-70, Venet., for he evidently avails himself of Xylander's emendations of the Aldine <i>editio
  princeps</i>, 1509-19. One cannot, however, be quite certain on this point, for the title-page of
  Holland's translation of the <i>Moralia</i> runs: "The Philosophie, commonly called the Morals,
  written by the learned philosopher Plutarch of Chaeronea, translated out of Greek into English,
  and conferred with Latin and French." Now the Latin translation must have been Xylander's; and the
  only edition of the text used by Holland may have been that of H. Stephens, with which Xylander's
  Latin translation and notes were published. The French with which Philemon conferred was of course
  that of Jacques Amyot, who had already translated Plutarch's <i>Lives</i> in 1559, and followed up
  that translation with one of <span class="pagenum" id="pagexi">{xi}</span>the <i>Moralia</i> in
  1574. Philemon's translation of the <i>Morals</i> appeared in 1603 ("revised and corrected" in
  1657).</p>

  <p class="sp5">The <i>Morals</i> in general and the <i>Romane Questions</i> in particular have
  received little attention from commentators. The only notes I have succeeded in getting hold of,
  besides those of Xylander and Reiske (complete edition of Plutarch, Lips., 1774-82), are some by
  Boxhorn (in the fifth volume of the <i>Thesaurus</i> of Grævius, 1696), which includes one
  sensible remark (quoted p. xxxii. below), and those by Wyttenbach (Oxford, 1821), which, if I had
  looked at them before instead of after writing my Introduction, would have provided me with a good
  many classical references that, as it is, I have had to put together myself.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexiii">{xiii}</span></div>

  <h3 class="sp3 ac" title="Introduction" style="margin-bottom:3.7ex;"><span
  class="larger">INTRODUCTION.</span></h3>

  <p class="ac">I. <span class="sc">The Subject of the "Romane Questions" and of this
  Introduction.</span></p>

  <p>The "fashions and customes of Rome," which prompted Plutarch's questions, are directly or
  indirectly associated with the worship of the gods, while the solutions which he suggests contain
  occasionally myths. It is not, however, all Roman gods, cults, and myths that are discussed by
  Plutarch: he limits himself, on the whole, to those which are purely Roman, or rather purely
  Italian. This limitation is not accidental, and it is significant. It does not indeed appear that
  Plutarch designed to confine himself thus: the fact seems rather to be that, long before his time,
  the Romans had borrowed the myths, the ritual, and the gods of Greece, and that Plutarch, as a
  Greek, found nothing strange or unintelligible in the resemblances <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexiv">{xiv}</span>which the Roman ritual of his day bore to the religion of his native
  land. It was the points of difference which caught his attention.</p>

  <p>And here we must note a further limitation of the subject of the <i>Romane Questions</i> and of
  this Introduction. Surprise and inquiry are excited not by the familiar, but by the unusual; so
  Plutarch's attention was arrested not by customs which, though purely Italian, were universal in
  Italy, <i>e.g.</i>, the practice of covering the head during worship, but by fashions for which he
  could find no analogy or parallel in the stage of religion with which alone he was acquainted. In
  such isolated customs, out of harmony with their surroundings, modern science sees "survivals"
  from an earlier stage of culture; and it is as survivals that they will be treated in this
  Introduction. Now, the stage of religion with which Plutarch was familiar, and in which he could
  find no analogies for those "fashions and customes," was polytheism; and if those practices are
  survivals, they must be survivals from a stage of religion earlier than polytheism.</p>

  <p>Here, however, a difficulty meets us. If the teaching of the Solar Mythologists be true, the
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagexv">{xv}</span>Aryans, having a mythology, were already polytheists:
  much more, therefore, must the Italians have been polytheists from the beginning. I am sorry to
  say that I cannot meet this difficulty: I can only frankly warn the reader that it exists. But in
  an Introduction which professes to confine itself to myths and cults which are purely Italian, it
  is impossible to discuss Solar Mythology, for the simple reason that there is no such thing in
  existence as an Italian solar myth, or indeed Nature-myth of any kind. The only story which is
  seriously claimed as a Nature-myth is that of Hercules and Cacus. Cacus, a monster or giant, stole
  some cows from Hercules, and hid them in his cave. Hercules discovered them, according to some
  accounts, by the aid of Caca, the sister of Cacus, according to other accounts, by the lowing
  which the cows in the cave set up when Hercules went by with the rest of his oxen. Hercules forced
  his way into the cave, and, in spite of the fire and flames which Cacus spat at him, killed the
  monster with his club. Then Hercules, in commemoration of the discovery of his cattle, erected an
  altar to Jupiter the Discoverer (<i>Jupiter Inventor</i>). Now a similar story, it would appear,
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagexvi">{xvi}</span>is to be found in the Vedas. Vritra, a three-headed
  snake, steals cows from Indra, who discovers them in a cave by their lowing, and kills Vritra with
  a club. And the Vaidic story must be a Nature-myth, because the Vedas expressly explain that the
  cows are clouds, the lowing is thunder, the club is the lightning, and Indra, on this occasion,
  the blue sky. But why is the interpretation given by the Vaidic philosophers to be accepted
  without examination, when we reject the teaching of the Stoics, who interpreted Rhea as matter,
  and Zeus, Posidon, and Hades as fire, water, and air respectively, in accordance with the Stoic
  philosophy of the universe? I submit it as a possibility, worth consideration at least, that we
  have here an ordinary folk-tale: the trick of using the bulls to make the cows reveal their
  hiding-place is like the trick in the folk-tale about the groom of Darius who caused his master's
  horse to neigh and so secured the Persian empire to Darius. The story may have been told of some
  clever fellow (not necessarily or probably of a god) in pro-ethnic Aryan times, or it may have
  been hit on by Hindoo and Italian story-tellers independently. Once invented, however, it was used
  by each of these <span class="pagenum" id="pagexvii">{xvii}</span>two peoples in a characteristic
  manner. The learned Roman, whose object was to explain the origin of the customs, cults,
  institutions, &amp;c., of Rome, seized on it as the obvious explanation of two facts which
  required explanation, viz., first, how the altar to Jupiter Inventor came into existence; and
  second, why the offering made in gratitude for the recovery of lost property, was an ox. The
  learned Hindoo, on the other hand, had the satisfaction of showing that even the stories with
  which (alone or chiefly) the common people were acquainted bore unsuspected witness to the truth
  of the religion he taught. But to return to our interpretation of the "fashions and customes" of
  Rome as survivals of a stage of religion earlier than polytheism.</p>

  <p>A second difficulty remains. Distinguished writers on the philosophy of religion hold that
  polytheism is not developed out of fetichism or animism, but is primitive and underived from any
  earlier stage. The survivals, then, which Plutarch records, could not point to the existence of an
  earlier stage. Here, again, it is not for me to handle such high themes as the philosophy of
  religion. I am bound down to the humbler task of noting the simple fact <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexviii">{xviii}</span>that, until borrowed from Hellas, polytheism was unknown in
  Italy.</p>

  <p class="sp3">This is a very bare statement&mdash;so naked as almost to amount to a literary
  impropriety. I must, therefore, take three sections to clothe it.</p>

  <p class="ac">II. <span class="sc">Italian Gods.</span></p>

  <p>That some of the great gods of Rome were but Greek gods borrowed is universally admitted (see
  <i>e.g.</i> Mommsen's <i>History of Rome</i>, i. 186 <i>ff.</i>, or Ihne, i. 119). Even so strong
  a supporter of the theory of a Græco-Italian period as Roscher admits unreservedly that the
  mythology, worship, and the very name of Apollo were borrowed in early but still historic times
  (<i>Lexikon</i>, i. 446). When, then, we find Plutarch putting the question why the temples of
  Æsculapius and Vulcan were built outside Rome (<i>Romane Questions</i>, 94 and 47), we at once
  surmise that these were imported gods, whose worship was indeed sanctioned and ordained by the
  Roman State but was not admitted within the sacred circle of the <i>pom&#x0153;rium</i>, reserved
  for the temples of indigenous Roman gods. In the case of Æsculapius we <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexix">{xix}</span>have historical proof that his was an imported worship; in consequence of
  a pestilence in Rome in <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 293 the god was fetched from Epidaurus,
  and the temple in question was erected two years afterwards.<a id="NtA_1"
  href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> We do not happen to have any similar historical record of the
  introduction of Vulcan's worship, but the name of the god, be it Cretan or Etruscan, is foreign.<a
  id="NtA_2" href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Having eliminated these and other loan-gods, we find that the genuine Italian deities which
  remain fall into two classes. The one class consists of such abstractions as Forculus, the spirit
  of doors; Cardea, that of hinges; Limentinus, that of the threshold, &amp;c., which can scarcely
  be dignified by the name of gods, but are rather spirits, and amply warrant Chantepie de la
  Saussaye's remark that Roman religion was still steeped in animism.<a id="NtA_3"
  href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> The other class includes <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexx">{xx}</span>such gods as Janus, Jupiter, Mars, Diana, Venus, Hercules, &amp;c. It is
  necessary to note, however, that the worship even of these gods can be proved to have been
  considerably Hellenised in historic times:<a id="NtA_4" href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> some of
  their ritual and all their mythology was borrowed from Greece, as we shall subsequently see. And
  when the loan-myths and loan-cults have been removed, the genuine Italian gods stand forth
  essentially and fundamentally different from those of Greece.<a id="NtA_5"
  href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a> Here, too, we may note that if comparative mythologists adhere to
  their principle of not identifying the gods of different nations, unless their names can be shown
  by comparative philology to be identical, they must admit that Mars and Ares, Venus and Aphrodite,
  Diana and Artemis, Juno and Hera, and all the other pairs of deities which the ancients
  identified, are, with the sole exception of Jupiter and Zeus and of Vesta and Hestia, not of
  cognate but of diverse origin. In fine, the differences between Greek and Italian gods are
  fundamental and original: the resemblances can be shown to be due to borrowing in historic
  times.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexxi">{xxi}</span></div>

  <p>There is, however, one of the great Roman gods who was never identified with any Hellenic
  deity, Janus. Now, although Janus ranks with Jupiter and Mars in the Roman system as an
  indubitable god, yet in origin and function he is not to be distinguished from those inferior,
  animistic powers to whom the title of spirit is the highest that can be assigned. Janus is the
  spirit that resides in or presides over door-openings (<i>ianus</i>, <i>ianua</i>), just as
  Forculus has to do with doors (<i>fores</i>), Limentinus with the threshold (<i>limen</i>), and
  Cardea with the hinges (<i>cardo</i>). He is also the "spirit of opening,"<a id="NtA_6"
  href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a> who was to be invoked at the commencement of every act. Plutarch's
  questions why he should be represented with two heads, and why the year should begin with the
  month named after him, January (<i>R. Q.</i>, 22 and 19), are thus at once explained: "The
  double-head looking both ways was connected with the gate that opened both ways;" and in January,
  "after the rest of the middle of winter, the cycle of the labours of the field began afresh."<a
  id="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a></p>

  <p>That the door or the threshold is the seat of <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexxii">{xxii}</span>a tutelary spirit or genius is a belief familiar enough in folk-lore:
  the door must not be banged,<a id="NtA_8" href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a> nor wood chopped on the
  threshold,<a id="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a> for fear of disturbing him. He is apt to
  disappear, taking the luck of the house with him, if a cat is maliciously buried under the
  door-sill,<a id="NtA_10" href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> or if human hair is so buried.<a
  id="NtA_11" href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a> The importance of the door as a possible entrance
  for evil spirits, or exit for lucky ones, is manifest in many customs, <i>e.g.</i>, nailing a
  horse-shoe on the door or sticking a knife into the door, and in such beliefs as that when a door
  opens (apparently) of itself, a spirit is entering.</p>

  <p>Whether the Italian spirit of the doorway, who in origin is indistinguishable from the similar
  though nameless spirits to be found elsewhere, was capable by his own unaided efforts of raising
  himself to the rank of a god, is matter for speculation. What is clear is that he had not the
  chance: the introduction of Greek polytheism into Italy promoted him without exertion on his
  part.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexxiii">{xxiii}</span></div>

  <p>As, thus far, I have assumed a distinction between "gods" and "spirits," and have also assumed
  that a belief in the latter may exist without polytheism and precede it, it will be well here to
  state explicitly the distinction. And that I may not be suspected of drawing the distinction so as
  to suit my own ends, I shall here borrow from a standard work, Chantepie de la Saussaye's
  <i>Religionsgeschichte</i> (i. 90). De la Saussaye notes five characteristics involved in the
  conception of "gods." First, they are related to one another as members of a family or community,
  and as subject to one god, who is either lord of all, or at any rate <i>primus inter pares</i>.
  Second, with the growth of art, they are represented plastically and are made in the image of man.
  Third, as ethics advance, moral benefits are associated with their worship. Hence, in the fourth
  place, the gods are conceived as personal, individual beings, ideally good and beautiful. Finally,
  the human intellect demands that the relations of the gods to one another and to Nature should be
  co-ordinated into a system, and so theogonies and cosmogonies are invented.</p>

  <p>Now, if these be the marks whereby gods are <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexxiv">{xxiv}</span>distinguished from spirits, I submit that, before the introduction of
  Greek gods and cults, the Romans had not advanced as far as polytheism, but were still in the
  purely animistic stage. Here again, to avoid the temptation of interpreting the evidence unduly in
  favour of the conclusion to which it seems to me to point, I will confine myself to quotations.
  Ihne (<i>Hist. of Rome</i>, i. 118) says that to the Romans, before the period of Hellenic
  influence, "the gods were only mysterious spiritual beings, without human forms, without human
  feelings and impulses, without human virtues or weaknesses.... Though the divine beings were
  conceived as male or female, they did not join in marriage or beget children.... No genuine Roman
  legend tells of any race of nobles sprung from gods." Again, "The original Roman worship had no
  images of the gods or houses set apart for them" (Mommsen, i. 183). "A simple spear, even a rough
  stone, sufficed as a symbol" (Ihne, 119). Roman religion had nothing to do with morality: "it was
  designed for use in practical life" (<i>Ibid.</i> 120). "The religion of Rome had nothing of its
  own peculiar growth even remotely parallel to the religion of Apollo <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexxv">{xxv}</span>investing earthly morality with its halo of glory" (Mommsen, 172).
  Mommsen's observation that "the hero-worship of the Greeks was wholly foreign to the Romans" (174)
  is explained by the fact that a hero is a being of human origin raised by good deeds to the rank
  of a god, and the Romans had no gods. Myths about the love-adventures of the gods and theogonies
  were unknown to early Rome.<a id="NtA_12" href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a> An Italian cosmogony
  has not yet been discovered, and even the wide-spread belief in the union of Father Sky and Mother
  Earth had not been evolved in Italy.</p>

  <p>In fine "the beings which the Romans worshipped were rather <i>numina</i> than personal
  gods."<a id="NtA_13" href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a> Even the spirits whom we can trace back
  under definite names to the purely Italian period, such as Jupiter, Juno, Vesta, Mars, are not
  individual, personal beings. Each of these names is the name of a class of spirits. "Each
  community of course had its own Mars, and deemed him to be the strongest and holiest of all"
  (Mommsen, i. 175). Each household had its own Vesta. There were many Jupiters, many Junos. In
  England, in the same way, the name of Puck, <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxvi">{xxvi}</span>who
  is a definite individual personality in one stage of our fairy mythology, was originally a
  class-name of the spirits whom, as Burton says in his <i>Anatomy</i>, "we commonly call
  poukes."</p>

  <p class="sp3">I will conclude this section with quotations from two distinguished authorities on
  Mythology, who would both dissent from the views which have been advanced above, but whose words
  seem to me to bear unintentional testimony in favour of those views. E. H. Meyer, in his
  <i>Indogermanische Mythen</i> (ii. 612), says, "Roman religion seldom displays more than the
  <i>elementary rudiments</i>, or rather let us say the last remnants of mythology," and "whereas
  the cult of the greater gods is known to us in a form greatly affected by Hellenism, ... the local
  gods usually scarcely rise above the rank of spirits (<i>sich meistens kaum über daemonischen Rang
  erheben</i>)." Preller, in his <i>Römische Mythologie</i> (i. 48), says, "The Romans' belief in
  gods would be termed more rightly <i>pandæmonism</i> than <i>polytheism</i>.... One is
  involuntarily reminded of those Pelasgians of Dodona who, according to Herodotus, assigned neither
  names nor epithets to their gods.... Indeed, most of the names of the oldest Roman gods have such
  a shifting, <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxvii">{xxvii}</span>indefinite meaning, that they can
  scarcely be regarded as proper names, as the names of persons."</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">III. Italian Cults.</span></p>

  <p>The Italians borrowed cults as well as gods from Greece, but "these external additions gathered
  round the kernel of the Roman religion without affecting or transforming its inmost core" (Ihne,
  i. 119). The distinguishing characteristic of the religion of Rome is that "it was designed for
  use in practical life" (<i>Ibid.</i> 120), "The god of the Italian was above all things an
  instrument for helping him to the attainment of very solid earthly objects" (Mommsen, i. 181). In
  fact, the Italian god was a fetich, <i>i.e.</i>, a magical implement; and in this sense of the
  word it is true that "the Romans saw everywhere and in all things the agency and the direction of
  the gods" (Ihne, i. 118). Every act of life was entangled in a complicated network of ritual.<a
  id="NtA_14" href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a> Every part of the house, the door, doorway,
  threshold, hinges, every process of farming, sowing, manuring, &amp;c., every act of life from
  birth to burial, had its own particular <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexxviii">{xxviii}</span>spirit; and the object of the Roman with reference to each
  particular spirit was "to manage, and even in case of need to over-reach or to constrain him"
  (Mommsen, i. 177). Preller in his <i>Römische Mythologie</i> characterises the religion of Rome
  as, above all things, "a cultus-religion." We may add that in Rome, as in China, Assyria, and
  Babylonia, the cult was nothing but organised magic,<a id="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a> the superstitious customs, charms, and incantations familiar to
  the folk-lorist in all countries were organised by the practical Roman and were state-established
  by him. In fine, the Romans "in their gods worshipped the abstract natural forces, to whose power
  man is conscious that he is subject every instant, but which he can win over and render
  subservient to his purposes by scrupulously obeying the external injunctions which the State
  issues for the worship of the gods."<a id="NtA_16" href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A fundamental difference between the Greek and Roman religions manifests itself in the matter
  of magic. Magic was foreign to the Greeks, and was disliked by them: when it appears in their
  mythology, it is practised by foreigners&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>, Medea, Circe, Hecate&mdash;and is
  "barbarous." In <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxix">{xxix}</span>fact, magic belongs to the
  animistic stage, and is opposed to the higher tendencies of polytheism. The forces of Nature,
  conceived as <i>numina</i> rather than as moral ideals, may well be influenced by magic to the
  advantage of the savage; but to control a deity by means other than prayer and good life is
  antitheistic.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Finally, it is not accidental or unmeaning that, on the one hand, the Greeks had
  oracles while the Italians had none; and on the other hand, that in China and Babylon (which
  resemble Rome in other pertinent points) divination played as large and as official a part as at
  Rome. An oracle is the voice of a god; whereas divination is simply sympathetic magic inverted.<a
  id="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">IV. Italian Myths.</span></p>

  <p>In sect. 1 it has been said that the Italians had no Nature-myths. The reason why they had none
  should now be clear: the Italians had no Nature-gods. The sky-spirit, Jupiter, was undoubtedly
  distinguished from the vault of heaven by the primitive Italians, but he was not generically
  different from the spirits of <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxx">{xxx}</span>vegetation, of
  sowing, of manuring, &amp;c., and he seems to have been even of inferior dignity to the spirit of
  doorways.<a id="NtA_18" href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a> The earth, on the other hand, does not
  seem to have been conceived of as a spirit even, much less as a goddess; but, if worshipped at
  all, was worshipped as a fetich.<a id="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a> Hence, the
  absence from Italy of any trace of the myth of the origin of all living creatures from a union
  between the earth and the sky.</p>

  <p>Indeed, if by a myth we mean a tale told about gods or heroes, there are no Italian myths.<a
  id="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> Myths attached to Greek loan-gods were borrowed with
  the gods from Greece. Myths in <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxxi">{xxxi}</span>which Italian gods
  figure were borrowed or invented when the Italian gods were identified with Greek gods. Thus the
  Golden Age myth, for instance, can be referred to the time (<span class="smaller">A.U.C.</span>
  257) when Saturnus was identified with Kronos.<a id="NtA_21" href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> And
  of course, all the myths in which Æneas appears, and the whole mythical connection between Rome
  and Greece or Troy, are late.<a id="NtA_22" href="#Nt_22"><sup>[22]</sup></a> Evander,<a
  id="NtA_23" href="#Nt_23"><sup>[23]</sup></a> again, who figures in various passages of the
  <i>Romane Questions</i>, owes his existence wholly and solely to the attempt to connect Rome with
  Greece.</p>

  <p>If, on the other hand, under the head of myth we include "the popular explanation of observed
  facts," then early Roman history, as Ihne says (i. 17), "is really nothing more than a string of
  tales, in which an attempt is made to explain old names, religious ceremonies and monuments,
  political institutions and antiquities, and to account for their origin." Some examples of this
  may be drawn from the <i>Romane Questions</i>. Marriage by capture has left traces <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexxxii">{xxxii}</span>behind it in the wedding customs of many countries,
  and the meaning of these survivals is usually wholly forgotten. But the historic consciousness of
  the Romans was so far alive to the actual facts of the case that the mock capture was explained as
  the commemoration of an actual historical rape&mdash;the Rape of the Sabines. Thus were explained
  the lifting of the bride over the threshold (<i>Q. R.</i> 19), the use of a javelin point to
  divide the bride's hair (<i>Ibid.</i> 87), the hymeneal cry <i>Talassio</i> (<i>Ibid.</i> 31), and
  the fact that maids might not (though widows might) marry on festival days (<i>Ibid.</i> 105). The
  first of these customs is probably a survival from marriage by capture, and the last is indirectly
  connected with it. In Rome,<a id="NtA_24" href="#Nt_24"><sup>[24]</sup></a> as in many other
  places,<a id="NtA_25" href="#Nt_25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> the lamentations of the bride who was
  actually captured survived in the formal, extravagant lamentations of the bride who, in quieter
  times, was more peacefully won; and these cries would have been of bad omen on a day dedicated to
  the worship of the gods. <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxxiii">{xxxiii}</span>Lamentation seems
  not to have been required of widows. The use of an iron javelin point is probably due to the
  dangers which, in the opinion of primitive man, attend on those about to marry, and require to be
  averted by the use of iron,<a id="NtA_26" href="#Nt_26"><sup>[26]</sup></a> from the head<a
  id="NtA_27" href="#Nt_27"><sup>[27]</sup></a> especially. The origin of the cry <i>Talassio</i> is
  beyond recovery.<a id="NtA_28" href="#Nt_28"><sup>[28]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">But though the chief branch of Italian folk-tales consisted of popular explanations
  of observed facts, we can detect traces of those other folk-tales which from the beginning must
  have been designed simply and solely to gratify man's inherent desire for tales of adventure and
  the marvellous. Here it must suffice to point to two of the <i>Romane Questions</i>. In the fourth
  question we have a tale told of successful trickery on the part of Servius Tullius, which may well
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxxiv">{xxxiv}</span>have formed part of some story of a Master
  Thief; and in <i>Romane Questions</i> 36, the nightly visits of Fortuna through the window to her
  lover, Servius Tullius, at once remind us of the "soul-maidens" and "swan-maidens," who visit, and
  eventually desert, their human lover through the window or the keyhole<a id="NtA_29"
  href="#Nt_29"><sup>[29]</sup></a>&mdash;the orthodox means of entrance and exit for spirits from
  the time of Homer at least.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">IV. The Soul.</span></p>

  <p>The customs and beliefs, the superstitious practices and supernatural beings, of modern
  European folk-lore are sometimes explained as the wrecks and remnants of the Pagan polytheism
  which preceded Christianity. And if the Aryan peoples were from the very beginning polytheists; if
  the Hellenes and the Hindoos, the Teutons and the Scandinavians, brought their myths and their
  cults with them from the original Aryan home, then this explanation seems more reasonable than
  that which <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxxv">{xxxv}</span>proceeds on a mere conjecture, a pure
  assumption that the Aryan religion was animistic ere it was polytheistic; for then we are obliged
  to relegate Aryan animism almost to the æon "of chaos and eternal night,"&mdash;at any rate, to an
  abysm of time which is such that neither linguistic palæontology nor any other science has
  dared</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p style="margin-left:4.90em">"to venture down</p>
    <p>The dark descent and up to reascend."</p>
  </div>

  <p>But if the proposition submitted in the previous sections be sound, if in early but still
  historic times Italian religion was still in a stage anterior to polytheism, then Aryan animism is
  no longer a mere assumption, and need no longer be thrust back into pro-ethnic times. Early
  Italian customs and beliefs will not be the <i>débris</i> of a previous polytheism, and it will
  therefore be unreasonable to explain their counterparts in modern folk-lore as mutilated myths or
  as the cult of gods degraded but worshipped still.</p>

  <p>Plutarch, in the fifth of his <i>Romane Questions</i> (p. 8 below), propounds an interesting
  problem: <i>Why are they who have beene falsly reported dead in a strange countrey, although <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexxxvi">{xxxvi}</span>they returne home alive, not received nor suffred to
  enter directly at the dores, but forced to climbe up to the tiles of the house, and so to get down
  from the roufe into the house?</i> This remarkable custom continued to be practised long after its
  origin and object had been forgotten; for Plutarch relates a tale which is obviously a popular
  explanation, invented to account for a practice the <i>rationale</i> of which had become
  unintelligible.<a id="NtA_30" href="#Nt_30"><sup>[30]</sup></a> Hard, however, as Plutarch's
  question appears at first sight, it may by the aid of modern folk-lore and savage custom be
  explained. We have to note, in the first place, that the mode of entry prescribed for the returned
  traveller is not spontaneously adopted by him; and presumably, therefore, is not prescribed in his
  interest: it is enforced by his relatives, and probably for their own protection. In the next
  place, though the traveller himself <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxxvii">{xxxvii}</span>knows, of
  course, that he has not returned from that bourne from which no traveller returns, his relatives
  have no such assurance: it may be, indeed, that he did not die whilst away, as they were informed
  or led to believe; but, on the other hand, he may be "the ghost of their dear friend dead,"
  seeking to obtain an entrance into his old home. The reasonable course for them to pursue,
  therefore, is to treat him as though he were a ghost: if he is no ghost, it will do him no harm;
  if he is, they will have protected themselves.</p>

  <p>Thus far our explanation is hypothetical: to verify the hypothesis it is necessary to show that
  the dead are or were as a matter of fact treated as the Roman custom prescribes that the <i>soi
  disant</i> living man shall be treated. That the spirits of the dead are considered unwelcome
  visitors both in modern folk-lore and by savage man, has been insisted on most recently by Mr. G.
  L. Gomme.<a id="NtA_31" href="#Nt_31"><sup>[31]</sup></a> I will, therefore, only add <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexxxviii">{xxxviii}</span>one or two instances of the precautions taken to
  prevent the return of the deceased to his home.<a id="NtA_32" href="#Nt_32"><sup>[32]</sup></a>
  The first thing is to get the soul out of the house; this may be effected by sweeping out the
  house and by flapping dusters about, care being taken to shake and turn upside down all vessels,
  meal-boxes, &amp;c., in which the soul might take refuge. Then the coffin must be carried foot
  foremost through the door; for if the corpse's face be turned to the house, the ghost can return.
  In Siam they run the corpse three times round the house, apparently on the same principle as, in
  the game of blind-man's buff, the blind-man is spun round in order to make him lose his bearings.
  In Bohemia they turn the coffin about cross-wise, outside the house-door, to prevent the dead man
  from coming back.</p>

  <p>More pertinent for our present purpose are the precautions taken to prevent the dead from
  obtaining access to the house through the door. The safest course is to carry the corpse out, not
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagexxxix">{xxxix}</span>through the door, for that gives the dead man
  the right of way which it is sought to bar, but through some opening which is specially made for
  the purpose and can be permanently closed. Thus the Hottentots make a breach through the wall for
  the purpose. The ancient Norsemen did the same.<a id="NtA_33" href="#Nt_33"><sup>[33]</sup></a>
  The Teutons, in pre-Christian times, dug a hole under the threshold and pulled the corpse through
  with a rope. In Christian times they only treated the bodies of criminals and suicides in this
  way, though in the thirteenth century Brother Berthhold of Regensburg recommended it in the case
  of heretics and usurers.</p>

  <p>When circumstances make it difficult or impossible to construct a special exit of this kind for
  the corpse, then some other means is found to avoid carrying the corpse through the door. The
  Eskimo take the body through a window; and a window was in 1858 used in Sonneberg in the case of a
  hanged man; while even now in East Prussia, if several children have died one after another, the
  corpse of the next to die is conveyed through the window.</p>

  <p>Eventually it comes to be considered <span class="pagenum" id="pagexl">{xl}</span>sufficient if
  a special means of egress is provided, not for the corpse, which is not likely to "walk," but for
  the spirit, which may want to return. Thus in China, at the moment of death, a small hole is made
  through the roof; while the custom of opening the window, to allow the soul of the dying man to
  depart, is universal in Germany and not unknown in England.</p>

  <p>Finally, all that is considered necessary to bar the right of way to the dead man's spirit is
  to close the house-door immediately after the departure of the corpse, and keep it closed until
  the return of the funeral party.</p>

  <p>If the explanation which has now been given of Plutarch's fifth question be correct, we must
  ascribe to the early Italians beliefs and customs similar to or identical with those quoted above
  from modern folk-lore; and it will not be illegitimate to seek further parallels to Italian
  religion from the same source. Thus, in <i>Romane Questions</i>, 51, Plutarch inquires why the
  Lares Præstites are represented as clad in dog-skins and as having a dog by their side.<a
  id="NtA_34" href="#Nt_34"><sup>[34]</sup></a> <span class="pagenum" id="pagexli">{xli}</span>Now,
  it is universally admitted that the Lar Familiaris of the Romans is the same as the house-spirit
  of the Teutons, and that both are the spirits of a deceased ancestor, the founder of the family
  and its spirit guardian. In the absence of any presumption to the contrary, we may conclude that
  the Lares Præstites were also spirits of deceased ancestors. The dog which accompanies the Lares
  was explained by the ancients as a symbolic representation of the fidelity and watch-dog functions
  of the Lares.<a id="NtA_35" href="#Nt_35"><sup>[35]</sup></a> So, too, the priests of ancient
  Egypt said that the animal forms in which their gods were represented were merely symbolical.<a
  id="NtA_36" href="#Nt_36"><sup>[36]</sup></a> But it may safely be laid down as a law in the
  evolution of religion that beast-worship is primitive, and that the theory of symbolism is but a
  <i>via media</i> whereby more elevated conceptions of deity are reconciled with the older and more
  savage worship. Analogy, then, is all in favour of the supposition that the Lares Præstites were
  originally conceived not in human shape, but in the form of dogs. What we require to confirm the
  analogy is evidence that the dead&mdash;if <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexlii">{xlii}</span>possible, evidence that guardian spirits&mdash;sometimes appear in the
  shape of a dog. As a matter of fact, the belief that a dead man's spirit may manifest itself in
  the likeness of a black dog still survives in Germany.<a id="NtA_37"
  href="#Nt_37"><sup>[37]</sup></a> As for the guardian spirit, I would suggest that the Mauthe dog
  of Peel Castle is a house-spirit; for as the hearth was the peculiar seat of the Lar Familiaris
  and of the Hûsing or Herdgota, and as the English house-spirit</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p style="margin-left:2.80em">"Stretch'd out all the chimney's length</p>
    <p>Basks at the fire;"</p>
  </div>

  <p>so the Mauthe dog, "as soon as candles were lighted, came and lay down before the fire."<a
  id="NtA_38" href="#Nt_38"><sup>[38]</sup></a> From this point of view we may consider that the
  black dog, which in modern folk-lore comes and lies down or howls before a house, in token that
  one of the inmates is about to die, was originally a spirit summoning the inmate to join the dead.
  This belief, it may further be conjectured, has been incorporated into Hindoo mythology, where a
  dog acts as the messenger of the death-god, Yama; and probably the Greek <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexliii">{xliii}</span>dog, Cerberus, was taken up into the literary mythology of Hellas
  from the same folk-belief.</p>

  <p>Finally, we may here notice the fifty-second of Plutarch's Questions, wherein he wonders why a
  dog was sacrificed to Genita Mana, and a prayer made to her that none born in the house should
  become Manes. Genita Mana was, as her name plainly indicates, a spirit of birth and of death; and
  the prayer was such as might properly be offered to her. The sacrifice may be explained on the
  principle laid down by Professor Robertson Smith,<a id="NtA_39" href="#Nt_39"><sup>[39]</sup></a>
  that an animal sacrificed to a deity was itself originally the deity. That one and the same spirit
  should have to do with "the child from the womb and the ghost from the tomb," points to the
  existence of a belief among the Romans similar to one held by the Algonkins. "Algonkin women who
  wished to become mothers flocked to the side of a dying person, in the hope of receiving and being
  impregnated by the passing soul."<a id="NtA_40" href="#Nt_40"><sup>[40]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Let us now turn to another point in which early Italian beliefs and modern folk-lore mutually
  illustrate each other. On the origin of <span class="pagenum" id="pagexliv">{xliv}</span>fairies
  various theories have been held, and without denying that fairies are sometimes the
  representatives of earlier gods, sometimes of still earlier satyrs, fauns, nymphs, and wild men of
  the wood, we may recognise that they are sometimes spirits of the departed. In the first place, as
  the Italians called the dead "the good," <i>manes</i>, so in England and in Ireland fairies are
  "the good people."<a id="NtA_41" href="#Nt_41"><sup>[41]</sup></a> Next, fairies are small; and
  the savage conceives the soul of man as a smaller man. It is, according to Hurons, "a complete
  little model of the man himself," like the man, but smaller, of course, because, as the Australian
  blacks explain, it is within the man's breast.<a id="NtA_42" href="#Nt_42"><sup>[42]</sup></a>
  According to Kaffir ideas, the world of <i>manes</i> is exactly like that of the living, only much
  smaller, and the dead are themselves but mannikins.<a id="NtA_43"
  href="#Nt_43"><sup>[43]</sup></a> Again, the Teutonic house-spirit on the one hand is admittedly a
  deceased ancestor, and on the other is an indubitable fairy. Further, fairies are sometimes
  explicitly stated in folk-tales to be deceased spirits.<a id="NtA_44"
  href="#Nt_44"><sup>[44]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagexlv">{xlv}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Now, one of most marked differences between the Greek and the Roman modes of
  worship was that the Greeks worshipped with their heads uncovered, the Romans with heads covered,
  <i>velato capite</i>. Roman antiquaries explained the practice as due to fear lest the worshipper
  should see anything of evil omen during his prayer. But I submit that we must connect it with the
  folk-belief that fairies resent being seen by mortals. "They are fairies; he that speaks to them
  shall die." If fairies were originally departed souls, the fear and the danger of seeing them is
  at once explained. On the other hand, the Roman custom of worshipping <i>velato capite</i> dates
  from a time before the introduction of polytheism, and must therefore have been attached
  originally to the worship of some beings other than gods. It is at least plausible, therefore, to
  conjecture that it was a precaution adopted in the worship of deceased ancestors and of spirits,
  which, like Genita Mana, are best explained as spirits of the departed. The conjecture is somewhat
  confirmed by the fact that the Romans veiled their heads at the funeral of father or mother (<i>R.
  Q.</i> 14).</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">V. Genii.</span></p>

  <p>No form of religion is easily or at once rooted out, even by a new religion. A <i>modus
  vivendi</i> has to be found between the old faith and the new. The animal, which was once itself
  worshipped, is tolerated merely as the symbol of some divine attribute. The nixies continue to ply
  their old calling under the new name of Old Nick. The sacrifices to the dead, condemned by the
  Indiculus Superstitionum, are subsequently licensed by the Church as the Feast of All Souls.<a
  id="NtA_45" href="#Nt_45"><sup>[45]</sup></a> Hence it comes about that what means one thing to
  the apostle of the new religion is long understood as something very different by the reluctant
  convert. The devil of folk-lore has attributes quite different from those assigned to him in any
  scheme of Christian theology.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, polytheism was, as I have suggested, an importation into Italy, forced by the
  State on a people not yet prepared for anything higher than animism and ancestor-worship, we
  should expect to find the borrowed worship of <span class="pagenum" id="pagexlvii">{xlvii}</span>a
  Greek loan-god sometimes concealing a native Italian cult of very dissimilar nature. Instances of
  the kind are forthcoming, and this section will be devoted to some of them.</p>

  <p>The spirits which after the death of the body were termed <i>manes</i> by the Romans, were
  during its life called <i>genii</i> (or in the case of women <i>Junones</i>). The belief in genii
  was not borrowed from Greece. How primitive it is may be seen from two facts. First, it is itself
  the essence of animism, for not only had every man a genius, but every place and every thing had,
  in the belief of the Romans, a soul, to which the same name, genius, was given.<a id="NtA_46"
  href="#Nt_46"><sup>[46]</sup></a> Next, the genius was, I submit, the "external soul," which, as
  Mr. Frazer has shown, appears in the folk-tales of every Aryan nation, and in the religions of
  many savage peoples. The genius of a man did not reside inside the man. Amongst the Romans, as
  amongst the Zulus, it resided in a serpent. As, according to the Banks Islanders, "the life of the
  man is bound up with the life of his tamanin,"<a id="NtA_47" href="#Nt_47"><sup>[47]</sup></a> so
  with the Romans, the man's <span class="pagenum" id="pagexlviii">{xlviii}</span>health depended on
  his genius.<a id="NtA_48" href="#Nt_48"><sup>[48]</sup></a> When the serpent which was the genius
  of the father of the Gracchi was killed, Tiberius died;<a id="NtA_49"
  href="#Nt_49"><sup>[49]</sup></a> and, as all Romans were liable to the same mischance, these
  snakes were carefully protected from all harm, were reared in the house and the bed-chamber, and
  consequently grew so numerous, that Pliny says, had their numbers not been kept down by occasional
  conflagrations, they would have crowded out the human inhabitants of Rome.<a id="NtA_50"
  href="#Nt_50"><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

  <p>This belief in the genius, however etherealised and spiritualised the form in which it appears
  in Horace or was held by highly-educated Romans, continued even in Imperial times amongst all
  other classes as primitive as it was tenacious. Its hold over the ordinary Italian mind was much
  greater than the Hellenised gods ever secured; for, in order to make them even comprehensible, the
  average Italian had to suppose that these fashionable, State-ordained gods were really worked by
  genii&mdash;just as it is self-evident to the savage that, <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexlix">{xlix}</span>if a locomotive engine moves, it is because it has horses inside. This,
  I suggest, is the explanation, in accord with the principle laid down at the beginning of this
  section, which must be given of the remarkable fact that, beginning from <span
  class="smaller">B.C.</span> 58,<a id="NtA_51" href="#Nt_51"><sup>[51]</sup></a> and in
  ever-increasing numbers afterwards, inscriptions are found which ascribe a genius to Apollo,
  Asclepius, Mars, Juno, Jupiter, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>In this case Italian animism has held its own, not unsuccessfully, against imported polytheism.
  Our second instance, however, will show it less successful. When polytheism was spreading from
  Hellas over Italy, there would be no difficulty in adding the myths and cult of the Greek god Zeus
  bodily on to the worship of the Italian sky-spirit Jupiter. Nor would the process be much harder
  even when the Greek god and the Italian spirit were of totally different origin (as <i>e.g.</i>
  Hermes and Mercury, Kronos and Saturn), provided that some point of resemblance, in attribute or
  function, could be discovered between them. It was only one, and the least important of Hermes'
  functions, to protect traders, but it was quite enough to <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagel">{l}</span>lead to the identification of the Greek god with the Italian spirit of gain
  (<i>Mercurius</i>, from <i>merces</i>). The case of Heracles, however, presented more difficulty;
  he was a hero, and the very conception of a hero was new to the Italians. Being new, it was, not
  unnaturally, misunderstood. The nearest parallel which Italian religion offered to a being who was
  in a way a man and yet was also a sort of god was the genius, who also was in a way the man
  himself, and yet was worshipped like a god. Heracles, therefore, was identified with the genius,
  his name was Latinised into the form <i>Hercules</i> (cf. <i>Æsculapius</i>, from
  <i>Asclepios</i>), and the cults of the two were amalgamated. This amalgamation is the source and
  the explanation of some of Plutarch's <i>Roman Questions</i>. Plutarch was puzzled by the fact
  that on the one hand some elements in the cult of Hercules had counterparts in the worship of the
  Greek god, while on the other hand there were elements which received no explanation from a
  comparison of the cult of the Greek Heracles. Thus Plutarch is surprised to find an altar common
  to Hercules and to the Muses (<i>R. Q.</i> 59); but this is simply a loan from the ritual of the
  Greek Heracles, <span class="pagenum" id="pageli">{li}</span>Musagêtês. On the other hand, as
  Plutarch informs us (<i>R. Q.</i> 60), there was an altar of Hercules from which women were
  excluded. This is a non-Greek element in the cult of Hercules, with which we may safely compare
  the fact, that whereas a man might swear "by his Hercules," a woman might not. Here the imported
  god has taken the place of the native genius both in the oath and at the altar; for the reason why
  the oath "me hercule" was restricted to men is that, until Hercules and the genius were
  identified, a man swore by his genius and a woman by her Juno. Again, in the time before Italy was
  invaded by the gods of Greece, in the time when temples were as yet unknown, the genius was
  worshipped and invoked, like other spirits, in the open air; and even after the Italians had
  learned from the Greeks that the gods were shaped in the likeness of men, and, like men, must have
  houses, an oath was felt to be more sacred and more binding if taken in the open air in the old
  fashion, than if sworn in the new way under a roof.<a id="NtA_52"
  href="#Nt_52"><sup>[52]</sup></a> Eventually, however, the old custom <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelii">{lii}</span>died out, and in Plutarch's day it was only children who were told that
  they must go out of doors if they wanted to swear "by Hercules" (<i>R. Q.</i> 28). Plutarch's
  attention was also arrested by the custom of giving tithes to Hercules (<i>R. Q.</i> 18). The
  practice is undoubtedly purely and characteristically Italian; but there is no evidence to show
  whether it was ever the custom to offer tithes to the genius. Another point, however, which is
  noted by Plutarch (<i>R. Q.</i> 90) in the cult of Hercules, may be more satisfactorily explained.
  When sacrifice was being offered to Hercules, no dog was suffered <i>to be seene, within the
  purprise and precinct of the place where the sacrifice is celebrated</i>. Now, if Hercules
  represents the genius, and if the dog was the shape in which a departed spirit appears, then the
  danger lest the genius should be tempted away by the Manes is great enough to account for the
  prohibition.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pageliii">{liii}</span></div>

  <p>This identification of Heracles with the genius shows in a striking way how far the Italians
  were from having reached the belief in personal individual gods at the time when Greek religion
  found its way into Italy, and how artificially Greek polytheism was superimposed on native
  beliefs. There were as many <i>genii virorum</i> as there were living men, and yet they were
  identified with Heracles.<a id="NtA_53" href="#Nt_53"><sup>[53]</sup></a> To the Italian convert,
  doubtless, it seemed nothing strange that every man should have his Hercules; while his Greek
  teacher probably never fully realised the catechumen's point of view.</p>

  <p>The case is parallel to that of Hestia and Vesta. Both before and after the appearance in Italy
  of the anthropomorphised Hestia, every Roman household revered its own "hearth-spirit;" yet this
  class of spirits came to be identified with the personal individual goddess <span class="pagenum"
  id="pageliv">{liv}</span>from Greece. Doubtless, also, in course of time Romans who shook off
  animism and became true polytheists explained the relation between their "hearth-spirits" and the
  State-goddess by regarding the former as so many manifestations of the latter. But it is, I
  submit, a mistake on the part of modern mythologists to accept this piece of late theology as
  primitive&mdash;unless, indeed, we are also prepared to say that the Lares were regarded as so
  many manifestations of one Lar, or all the many Manes as manifestations of one dead man. The
  <i>genii virorum</i>, at any rate, were not, in the first instance, so many manifestations of
  Hercules: on the contrary, they existed (in Italy), to begin with, and Heracles afforded them a
  collective name and a Greek cult.</p>

  <p>In the same way, I submit, the original Italian Juno was no Nature-deity, no
  moon-goddess&mdash;the name was that of a class of spirits, like the correlative term <i>genii
  virorum</i>. There were many Junones, as there were many fauns in Italy, many satyrs and nymphs in
  Greece, many Pucks and fairies in England. When the Italians learnt that Hera was the goddess
  under whose protection the Greek women were, they <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelv">{lv}</span>naturally thought of the Juno who was the guardian-spirit of each Italian
  woman, and applied to Juno the cult and myths that belonged to Hera. Hence the answer to
  Plutarch's question, why were the months sacred to Juno? (<i>R. Q.</i> 77). Because they were
  sacred to Hera.</p>

  <p class="sp3">But there were other spirits whom Italian women invoked besides their Junones, such
  as Juga, who yoked man and wife, Matrona, Pronuba, Domiduca, Unxia, Cinxia, Fluonia, Lucina, and
  other departmental spirits or <i>indigetes</i>, whose names appear in the <i>Indigitamenta</i>.
  These spirits, when once Juno had become a personal individual deity, came to be explained as
  special manifestations of the goddess, who was consequently called Juno Juga, Juno Matrona,
  &amp;c.<a id="NtA_54" href="#Nt_54"><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagelvi">{lvi}</span></div>

  <p class="ac">VI. <span class="sc">Di Indigetes.</span></p>

  <p>Before Greek gods and myths were known to them, the Italians worshipped not only Lares, Manes,
  Genii, and Junones, but also the spirits known as Di Indigetes. These spirits were not conceived
  in human or in animal form. They had not human parts or passions. They did not form a community.
  They had no common abode. There is nothing in Italian religion corresponding to the Olympus of
  Greek mythology. They did not marry or give in marriage. Above all, what distinguishes them both
  from Greek gods and from the tree-spirits, which also were worshipped by the Italians, is that
  they were rather <i>numina</i> or forces than beings. They were the forces which regulated and
  controlled all human actions, psychological and physiological, and through which all the work of
  man's hands could alone be brought to a favourable issue. When, however, we come to examine these
  <i>numina</i>, we find that the name <span class="pagenum" id="pagelvii">{lvii}</span>of the
  <i>Indiges</i> is simply the name of the action which he controls: the <i>Indiges</i> of sowing is
  Saturnus; of remembering, Minerva; of suckling, Rumina, and so on. It is a canon of savage logic
  that he who possesses the name of a person or thing has that person or thing in his power; hence
  the Roman's belief that he could control any process, psychical or physical, if only he could put
  a name to it. This primitive form of magic was organised by the Roman State. The pontiffs were
  intrusted with the duty of drawing up catalogues (<i>indigitamenta</i>) of all the stages and
  processes of a man's life, from his begetting and birth to his death and burial; and as the State
  was but a community of farmers, similar catalogues were made of all the agricultural operations by
  which crops are raised. To be effectual, it was necessary that these lists should be complete. As
  the Roman could avert or remedy any evil by simply naming the proper spirit, it was essential that
  his roll of spirits should have no omissions. Then, if he were in doubt what spirit to name, he
  could make assurance doubly sure by naming all.</p>

  <p>Let it not be imagined that this State-organised magic, though it appear to us inconsistent
  with <span class="pagenum" id="pagelviii">{lviii}</span>civilisation, is mere matter of inference,
  or belongs purely to pre-historic times. Not only did it survive the introduction of polytheism,
  it was a firm article of Roman faith in the most glorious days of the Republic, and until <span
  class="smaller">B.C.</span> 211 or later, the belief was so living as to give birth continually to
  fresh spirits, as fresh departments of human activity were opened up.<a id="NtA_55"
  href="#Nt_55"><sup>[55]</sup></a> Nor did it cease then. It changed, but it did not die. In the
  worship of such abstractions as Fortuna, Spes, Juventas, Concordia, Pietas, Libertas, Felicitas,
  Annona, &amp;c., we have evidence that abstract names exercised as great a hold over the minds of
  Romans of the Empire as they had over the earliest Italians.</p>

  <p>On some <i>indigetes</i> Greek cults and myths were grafted, and these <i>numina</i>, which
  were in truth but <i>nomina</i>, henceforth lived as gods. Mercurius was declared to be Hermes.
  Minerva, the spirit of memory, was seen to be Athênê, the goddess of wisdom. Saturnus was
  identified with Kronos, <span class="pagenum" id="pagelix">{lix}</span>and was henceforth
  worshipped in the Greek fashion with uncovered head (<i>R. Q.</i> 13). Opis was identified with
  Dêmêtêr, Venus with Aphroditê, and Libitina, the <i>numen</i> of funerals, was interpreted, by a
  pedantic etymological confusion with Libentina, as a bye-name of the new goddess (<i>R. Q.</i>
  23). The <i>indiges</i> Liber<a id="NtA_56" href="#Nt_56"><sup>[56]</sup></a> was recognised in
  Dionysius Eleutherios (<i>R. Q.</i> 104).</p>

  <p>In all these cases the identification proceeded on a fancied resemblance in name or an actual
  similarity of function. There seems to be only one instance of identification based on similarity
  of cult, that of the Roman Matuta and the Greek Leucothea. According to Plutarch (<i>R. Q.</i> 16)
  maid-servants were excluded from the temples of both, except when <i>the Dames of Rome, bringing
  in thither one alone and no more with them, fall to cuffing and boxing her about the eares and
  cheeks</i>. Here the servant is the scapegoat, to whom are transferred the evils which may or
  might afflict the free women of the community, and the beating is done for purification. It is
  just conceivable that the Greek cult may have been borrowed by the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelx">{lx}</span>Romans; but the use of a scapegoat and of beating in this way is so
  wide-spread over all the world, and so deeply seated in European folk-lore, that it is difficult
  to imagine it was unknown to the Romans. As a matter of fact, even in the <i>Roman Questions</i>,
  without going further, we have indications that both practices were known in Italy. In <i>R.
  Q.</i> 20 a myth is given, the earlier form of which is to be found in Macrobius (<i>S.</i> i.
  12), who states that the Bona Dea was on a day scourged with myrtles. On the principle that
  customs often give rise to myths but cannot be originated by them, we may infer that the
  representative, or else the worshippers of the Bona Dea, were purified by scourging. Still less
  can it be doubted after Mannhardt's exhaustive investigation (<i>Myth. Forsch.</i>, pp. 72
  <i>ff.</i>), that the Luperci, described in <i>R. Q.</i> 68, drove out the evil spirits of
  disease, sterility, &amp;c., by the blows from their scourges. Again, the expulsion of evil tends
  in many places to become periodic; a day or season is devoted annually to the driving out of all
  devils and evil spirits, after which the community is expected to live sober and clean. The
  community, not unnaturally, indulges in a kind of <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxi">{lxi}</span>carnival immediately before this season, and allows itself all sorts of
  license: slaves behave as though they were masters, men dress up in women's clothes, &amp;c. This,
  presumably, is the explanation of the fact related by Plutarch (<i>R. Q.</i> 55), that <i>upon the
  Ides of Januarie, the minstrels at Rome who plaied upon the hautboies, were permitted to goe up
  and downe the city disguised in women's apparell</i>.<a id="NtA_57"
  href="#Nt_57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Though the influence of Hellenic religion failed to transform the many other <i>indigetes</i>
  into gods, still it affected their cult in other ways. For one thing, it provided them now for the
  first time with temples or chapels. This innovation was doubtless found strange by the folk to
  whom the fashionable ideas from Hellas penetrated slow and late. In the case of Carmenta it must
  have seemed particularly strange. Carmenta was one of the several <i>indigetes</i> whose power was
  manifested in the <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxii">{lxii}</span>various processes of
  gestation;<a id="NtA_58" href="#Nt_58"><sup>[58]</sup></a> and she was invoked as Porrima (Prorsa
  or Antevorta) or Postverta, according as the child came into the world head or foot foremost. From
  the mention of a <i>saxum Carmentæ</i>,<a id="NtA_59" href="#Nt_59"><sup>[59]</sup></a> near which
  was the <i>porta Carmentalis</i>, and near which the temple in question was erected, we may
  venture to infer that this rock was originally the local habitation of the spirit. Why then needed
  she to have a temple built? This was a point which, to the popular mind, required explanation; and
  a popular explanation was accordingly forthcoming, which has fortunately been preserved to us by
  Plutarch. It starts from a folk-etymology or confusion between the name Carmenta and the word
  <i>carpenta</i>, meaning "coaches," and may be read at length in <i>R. Q.</i> 56.</p>

  <p>There remains one other <i>indiges</i> who is mentioned in the <i>Romane
  Questions</i>&mdash;Rumina (<i>R. Q.</i> 57) the <i>numen</i> of suckling. As the temple <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagelxiii">{lxiii}</span>of Carmenta was erected near the <i>saxum
  Carmentæ</i>, so the <i>sacellum</i> of Rumina was built near the <i>ficus Ruminalis</i>; and as
  we may conjecture that the rock was in the nature of a fetich, so we may infer that Rumina was a
  tree-spirit. It is easy to understand why a fig-tree was chosen as the abode of the spirit of
  suckling; the sap of this tree resembles milk and was known to the Romans as <i>lac</i>. The fact
  reported by Plutarch,<a id="NtA_60" href="#Nt_60"><sup>[60]</sup></a> that milk, not wine, was
  offered in the cult of Rumina, is quite in accord with the principles of sympathetic magic.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The worship of this spirit bears every mark of hoar antiquity, and it was worked
  into the legend of the foundation of Rome by the device of making the wolf suckle the twins under
  the <i>ficus Ruminalis</i>.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">VII. Tree and Field Cults.</span></p>

  <p>Whenever two peoples come into contact with each other for the first time, a comparison of
  religions is set up; and one of the first-fruits of this earliest exercise of the comparative
  study of religions is that identification of gods and <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxiv">{lxiv}</span>borrowing of cults and myths to which the term "syncretism" is applied.
  The part played by syncretism in the history of Italian religion is of singular importance: the
  Italian's misty, vaporous belief in abstract, impersonal spirits was precipitated into premature
  polytheism by the introduction of the anthropomorphic gods of Greece. Fortunately, the process
  being premature, was, and to the end remained, incomplete; and we are therefore able to employ the
  survivals from the older form of belief so as to form some idea of the original Italian religion.
  To the last, many spirits resisted the individualising process, which is the essence and condition
  of polytheism: the Lares and the Manes not only never became gods, but none of them was dignified
  by a proper name, or attained even so much individuality as Puck or Robin Goodfellow. Not can such
  general abstract appellations as Bona Dea, Dea Dia, be regarded as personal names, <i>i.e.</i>, as
  the names of definite, individual, personal beings: they have not the personality of Venus or
  Vulcan, and yet they were the beings whom the people at large worshipped in preference to the
  State-gods, whose cult and myths were fashionably Hellenised.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagelxv">{lxv}</span></div>

  <p>She who, under the influence of Greek religion, became the goddess Diana, was originally a
  tree-spirit, having no personal name, but known only by an appellation as general and abstract as
  that of Bona Dea. The proof that the qualities and attributes of the Greek goddess Artemis were
  attached by syncretism to the Italian tree-spirit is brought to light by two of Plutarch's
  penetrating questions (<i>R. Q.</i> 3 and 4), why harts' horns are set up in all the temples of
  Diana save that on Mount Aventine, in which are ox-horns? and why men are excluded from one
  particular temple of the same goddess? These differences in cult obviously point to the worship of
  different goddesses under the same name; and, as a matter of fact, we know first that harts were
  sacred to the Greek goddess, Artemis, whereas the genuine Italian Diana was the goddess of oxen;
  next, we know that the identification of Artemis and Diana was effected by Servius Tullius.<a
  id="NtA_61" href="#Nt_61"><sup>[61]</sup></a> To understand the exclusion of men from the temple
  in the Patrician Street, however, we must inquire into the nature of the Italian Diana. With this
  object, <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxvi">{lxvi}</span>we may either assume that the pro-ethnic
  Aryans were polytheists, and that therefore the primitive Italians also worshipped Nature-gods; in
  which case, starting from the etymology of the word Diana (from the root <i>div</i>, "shine"), we
  must either at once make Diana a moon-goddess,<a id="NtA_62" href="#Nt_62"><sup>[62]</sup></a> and
  thus account for the fact that she was a goddess of child-birth, and therefore men were excluded
  from her temple. But this seems improbable even to a writer in Roscher's <i>Lexikon</i> (Birt),
  who very properly notes (p. 1007) that "it is doubtful whether the belief that the moon influenced
  child-birth can be shown to be Italian." Birt, therefore, interprets the name to mean "the bright
  goddess," <i>i.e.</i>, the goddess of bright daylight, and boldly writes it down as a matter of
  course that the first attribute of a daylight or sky goddess is her close relation to vegetable
  nature, especially woods and forests. Those who find this mortal leap beyond their power to
  follow, and who prefer to argue to the original nature of the goddess from what we know of her
  cult as a matter of fact, rather than from hypotheses as to the Nature-myths of the primitive
  Aryans, will note first that her name <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxvii">{lxvii}</span>is as
  purely general and abstract as that of the Dea Dia or the Bona Dea, and means simply a bright
  spirit, or possibly simply a spirit. Next, wherever Diana was worshipped in Italy, she was
  originally worshipped in woods and groves, <i>e.g.</i>, in the forests on Mount Tifata, Mount
  Algidus at Anagnia, Corne, and Aricia. Indeed, in Aricia the place of her worship was simply
  called <i>Nemus</i>, and the goddess herself plain <i>Nemorensis</i>. In the next place, her
  worship is frequently associated with that of Silvanus,<a id="NtA_63"
  href="#Nt_63"><sup>[63]</sup></a> who is plainly a wood-spirit, and who is also a patron-spirit of
  domestic cattle.<a id="NtA_64" href="#Nt_64"><sup>[64]</sup></a> From this we may venture to class
  her with the "agrestes feminæ quas silvaticas vocant" of Burchard of Worms:<a id="NtA_65"
  href="#Nt_65"><sup>[65]</sup></a> she is a wood-spirit who became a goddess because of her
  likeness to the Greek Artemis. Her connection with child-birth does not indicate that she was a
  moon-goddess. Roman women in primitive times, like Swedish women, "twined their arms about a tree
  to ensure easy delivery in the pangs of child-birth; <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxviii">{lxviii}</span>and we remember how, in our English ballads, women, in like time of
  need, 'set their backs against an oak.'"<a id="NtA_66" href="#Nt_66"><sup>[66]</sup></a> Finally,
  the annual washing and cleansing of the head, which Plutarch mentions in <i>R. Q.</i> 100, was
  done on a day sacred to Diana, probably because, on the one hand, women felt that they were under
  her protection specially, while, on the other, so great is the sanctity of the head amongst
  primitive peoples,<a id="NtA_67" href="#Nt_67"><sup>[67]</sup></a> that washing it is not to be
  undertaken lightly: "the guardian spirit of the head does not like to have the hair washed too
  often, it might injure or incommode him."<a id="NtA_68" href="#Nt_68"><sup>[68]</sup></a></p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagelxix">{lxix}</span></div>

  <p>The <i>Romane Questions</i> afford another instance in which syncretism has obscured the
  original nature of an Italian field-spirit, and in which the cult of the Hellenised deity still
  betrays the primitive object of worship. In the pages of Virgil, Mars has so completely assumed
  the guise of the Greek Ares, that if we had only the verses and the mythology of the court-poet to
  instruct us, we could never even suspect that Mars had other functions than those of a war-god.
  When, however, we turn from myth to cult, and are confronted by the ceremony of the October horse,
  described in <i>R. Q.</i> 97, we find, that though Mars was sung as "Lenker der Schlachten," he
  was worshipped as the spirit that makes the corn to grow. At Rome the corn-spirit was represented
  as a horse, as it still is amongst the peasants of Europe, not only near Stuttgart, but in our own
  country, in Hertfordshire and in Shropshire. The fructifying power of the spirit is supposed in
  modern folk-lore and in Africa, as it was at Rome, to reside specially in the animal's tail, which
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxx">{lxx}</span>therefore was preserved over the hearth of the
  king's house, in order to secure a good harvest next year. The antiquity of this custom at Rome,
  and the fact that it dates from long before the Romans knew anything of the Greek Ares, are shown
  by the fight for the horse's head waged between the inhabitants of the two wards, the Via Sacra
  and the Subura, a fight which shows that the ceremonial goes back to a time when the Subura and
  Rome were separate and independent villages.</p>

  <p class="sp3">In connection with the killing of the corn-spirit, we may note a passage of the
  <i>Romane Questions</i> (63) which has not yet taken its place in modern works on the subject.
  Speaking of the <i>rex sacrorum</i>, Plutarch says, "Neere unto <i>Comitium</i>, they use to have
  a solemn sacrifice for the good estate of the citie; which, so soone as ever this king hath
  performed, he taketh his legs and runnes out of the place as fast as ever he can." Necessary as it
  was, according to primitive notions, that the vegetation-spirit should be, as it were, decanted
  into a new vessel, when the animal in which he was for the time residing was threatened with
  infirmity and decay, still the killing of the sacred <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxi">{lxxi}</span>animal was a dangerous and semi-sacrilegious act. Hence in Greece, the
  man who killed the ox in the sacrifice known as the <i>bouphonia</i> ran away as soon as he had
  felled the animal, and was subsequently tried for murder, but was acquitted on the ground that the
  axe was the real murderer; and so the axe was found guilty and cast into the sea. The Roman
  <i>regifugium</i> is obviously a fragment of a similar rite. The folk-explanation treated it as a
  symbol commemorative of the expulsion of the Tarquinii.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">VIII. Man-Worship.</span></p>

  <p>The rules of life prescribed for the priest of Jupiter, the Flamen Dialis, are given in part by
  Plutarch (<i>Q. R.</i> 40, 44, 50, 109, 110, 111, 112, and 113),<a id="NtA_69"
  href="#Nt_69"><sup>[69]</sup></a> and are a signal instance of the necessity of explaining Roman
  cults, not by reference to the artificial mythology of the Vedas or to the civilised myths of
  Greece, but to the customs of peoples who are still steeped in animism. That a spirit may take up
  its abode as a Dryad in a tree or in an animal, as in the beasts worshipped by the ancient
  Egyptians, or may <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxii">{lxxii}</span>temporarily take possession
  of a human being, as Apollo possessed the Pythian priestess, is easily comprehended. But that a
  spirit should permanently dwell in a man, and that the man should exercise all the powers and
  receive all the worship that belong to the spirit, would be almost incredible were it not for the
  numerous instances of such worship collected by the erudition of Mr. Frazer.<a id="NtA_70"
  href="#Nt_70"><sup>[70]</sup></a> In Japan the sun-goddess dwelt in the Mikado; in Lower Guinea
  and among the Zapotecs of South Mexico the sun-spirit takes human form. In Cambodia the spirit of
  fire and the spirit of water manifest themselves in the (human) kings of fire and water.
  Rain-kings are found on the Congo, the Upper Nile, and among Abyssinian tribes. The weather-spirit
  is worshipped in the kings of Loango, Mombaza, Quiteva, the Banjars, and the Muyscas. In the South
  Sea Islands, generally, "every god can take possession of a man and speak through him."<a
  id="NtA_71" href="#Nt_71"><sup>[71]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In the next place, these divine kings or priests are all charged with a force which enables
  them to control the course of Nature. Lest, therefore, this force should be inadvertently and
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxiii">{lxxiii}</span>unintentionally discharged, with results
  disastrous to the recipient of the shock or to the universe at large, the divine priest or king
  must be insulated. And this insulation is effected by taboos: every action is taboo to him which
  might bring him into dangerous contact with others.<a id="NtA_72"
  href="#Nt_72"><sup>[72]</sup></a></p>

  <p>When, therefore, we learn that the Flamen Dialis was subject to a very large number of taboos,
  all of which find analogies, while some find their exact counterparts, in the taboos laid on the
  divine priests and kings previously mentioned; and when we further discover that Preller,<a
  id="NtA_73" href="#Nt_73"><sup>[73]</sup></a> on totally different grounds, considered the Flamen
  to have been "the living counterpart" of Jupiter, it seems not unreasonable to regard the Flamen
  Dialis as the human embodiment of the sky-spirit.</p>

  <p>The Flamen, according to Plutarch (<i>R. Q.</i> 40), was forbidden to anoint his body in the
  open air, <i>i.e.</i> <i>sub Jove</i>; and of the Mikado we are told, "Much less will they suffer
  that he should expose his sacred person to the open air."<a id="NtA_74"
  href="#Nt_74"><sup>[74]</sup></a> The Flamen was forbidden to touch <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxiv">{lxxiv}</span>meal or raw meat, <i>i.e.</i>, meal or meat which might be consumed
  by others; so, too, the vessels used by the Mikado were "generally broke, for fear they should
  come into the hands of laymen; for they believe religiously that if any layman should presume to
  eat his food out of these sacred dishes, it would swell and inflame his mouth and throat."<a
  id="NtA_75" href="#Nt_75"><sup>[75]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="sp3">For the many other taboos imposed on the Flamen, I must refer to Mr. Frazer's great
  work.<a id="NtA_76" href="#Nt_76"><sup>[76]</sup></a> I will here only mention one, which is not
  explicitly explained in the <i>Golden Bough</i>. If the Flamen's wife died, he had to resign
  (<i>Q. R.</i> 50). Now, it is obvious from this that a widowed Flamen was somehow dangerous or in
  danger, and that the danger was one which re-marriage would not avert. I submit, therefore, that a
  widowed Flamen was considered in danger of sudden death, and that this danger (a danger to the
  community, which might thus lose the sky-spirit) consisted in the probability that the soul of the
  departed wife might tempt <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxv">{lxxv}</span>away the soul of the
  living Flamen. In Burmah, proper precautions are taken to prevent a baby's soul from following
  that of its dead mother, or the soul of a bereaved husband or wife from rejoining the lost one, or
  to prevent the soul of a dead child "from luring away the soul of its playmate to the
  spirit-land."<a id="NtA_77" href="#Nt_77"><sup>[77]</sup></a> But accidents will happen, and it is
  so important for an agricultural community to have the sky-spirit under direct control, that the
  Romans were doubtless well advised in running no risks, and in transferring the spirit into
  another Flamen.</p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">IX. Taboos.</span></p>

  <p>In fairy tales it is not surprising that the hero should be forbidden to see his wife on
  certain days, or whilst she is washing, or at night, and that he should be required to take
  precautions lest he should take her unawares in one of the forbidden moments.<a id="NtA_78"
  href="#Nt_78"><sup>[78]</sup></a> But it is surprising to find that the prosaic Roman
  punctiliously observed fairy etiquette in these <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxvi">{lxxvi}</span>matters, and habitually behaved like an inhabitant of fairy-land. See
  <i>R. Q.</i> 9 and 65. It is also surprising to discover that in Italy, where, owing to "the
  vigorous development of the marital authority, regardless of the natural rights of persons as
  such," the wife's "moral subjection became transformed into legal slavery,"<a id="NtA_79"
  href="#Nt_79"><sup>[79]</sup></a> the wife was "exempted from the tasks of corn-grinding and
  cooking," because, according to Mommsen, those tasks were menial.<a id="NtA_80"
  href="#Nt_80"><sup>[80]</sup></a> The exemption is mentioned by Plutarch in <i>R. Q.</i> 85; but
  we must take leave to question Mommsen's explanation. The exemption is not an exemption, but a
  prohibition: it is identical with the taboo laid on the Flamen Dialis (<i>R. Q.</i> 109), and has
  the same object. Doubtless if a Roman ate food touched by a woman, "it would swell and inflame his
  mouth or throat," or have some disastrous effect. For that even indirect contact with women at
  certain periods, <i>e.g.</i> child-birth, &amp;c., is highly dangerous, is a belief found amongst
  the Australian blacks and the Eskimo, the Indians of North America, and the Kafirs of South
  Africa. An Australian blackfellow, having been brought accidentally <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxvii">{lxxvii}</span>into this dangerous contact, died of terror within a fortnight.<a
  id="NtA_81" href="#Nt_81"><sup>[81]</sup></a> It is not strange, therefore, that the Romans,
  returning home after absence, <i>if their wives were at home, used to send a messenger unto them
  before, for to give warning and advertisement of their comming</i>. And we can understand that the
  primitive public for whom the fairy tales in question were composed found the incident of the
  violated taboo as thrilling and as full of "actuality" as a modern reader finds the latest
  sensational novel.</p>

  <p class="sp3">The belief that a mother and her new-born babe are peculiarly at the mercy of
  malevolent spirits is world-wide. In the fairy tales of Christian Europe the period of danger is
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxviii">{lxxviii}</span>terminated by baptism, until which time
  various precautions, such as burning a light in the chamber, must be observed.<a id="NtA_82"
  href="#Nt_82"><sup>[82]</sup></a> In ancient Italy the danger ended when the child received its
  name, which, as Plutarch (<i>R. Q.</i> 103) informs us, was on the ninth day after birth in the
  case of boys, on the eighth in the case of girls. Until that day a candle was to be kept lighted,
  and the spirit Candelifera was to be invoked. On that day the child was purified (which indicates
  an original taboo), and received the <i>bulla</i>, mentioned by Plutarch (<i>R. Q.</i> 102), to
  preserve him henceforth from evil spirits and the evil eye. Whether the <i>bulla</i> derived its
  virtue from the substances which were enclosed in it, as in a box, or from its moon shape, is
  uncertain. If the latter be the true explanation, we may compare the fact recorded by Plutarch
  (<i>R. Q.</i> 76), <i>that those who are descended of the most noble and auncient houses of Rome
  carried little moones upon their shoes</i>. The daughters of Sion also wore as amulets "round
  tires like the moon" (Isaiah, iii. 18). The moon-spirit sends disease or takes possession of the
  person who is "lunatick" or "moon-struck." But the spirit <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxix">{lxxix}</span>may be deluded, and will enter any moon-shaped object which the
  person attacked is wearing. The Chaldæans diverted the spirit of disease from the sick man by
  providing an image in the likeness of the spirit to attract the plague.<a id="NtA_83"
  href="#Nt_83"><sup>[83]</sup></a></p>

  <p class="ac"><span class="sc">X.&mdash;Sympathetic Magic.</span></p>

  <p>The traveller who has little or no acquaintance with the language of the land in which he is,
  resorts naturally to the language of gesture, and mimics the thing which he wishes to have done.
  Primitive man communicates his wishes to Nature in exactly the same way: if he wishes to have game
  caught in the trap which he sets, he first pretends to fall into it himself. He has not learnt to
  "interrogate" Nature in her own language by means of experiment and crucial instances, but he has
  a presentiment of the <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxx">{lxxx}</span>method of Concomitant
  Variations and of the Substitution of Similars. If a thing is itself beyond his reach, he
  substitutes its counterpart, its image or its name, or something related to it or connected with
  it, in confidence that any changes he may work in the one will be accompanied by concomitant
  variations in the other. Hence the reluctance shown by many savages to allow their likenesses to
  be taken or their names to be known, as with the name or the likeness the man himself would pass
  into the power of the stranger.<a id="NtA_84" href="#Nt_84"><sup>[84]</sup></a> So the Romans, as
  Plutarch informs us (<i>R. Q.</i> 61), kept the name of their tutelar god secret, for the same
  reason, as Plutarch acutely observes, as other nations kept the images of their gods chained;<a
  id="NtA_85" href="#Nt_85"><sup>[85]</sup></a>  and for the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxxi">{lxxxi}</span>same reason, we may add, as the Romans forbade the living counterpart
  of the sky-spirit to leave the city, viz., lest he should pass out of their control.</p>

  <p>In the same spirit, the Romans would not allow a table to be completely stripped of food (<i>R.
  Q.</i> 64) or a light to be extinguished (75): the action might produce permanent effects. The
  same feeling prevailed or prevails with regard to the table in Chemnitz, though it is regarded as
  a sign of death if a light goes out of its own accord.<a id="NtA_86"
  href="#Nt_86"><sup>[86]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The practice of allowing the spoils taken from an enemy to rust&mdash;a practice which Plutarch
  (37) cannot comprehend&mdash;was doubtless a piece of sympathetic magic: as the armour rusted, the
  enemy's power of armed resistance would diminish.</p>

  <p>Another interesting instance of sympathetic magic lurks in <i>R. Q.</i> 32. The images which,
  as Plutarch says, were thrown into the river, represented a spirit of vegetation or a corn-spirit;
  and the object of plunging them into the river was thereby to secure that the crops <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxii">{lxxxii}</span>should be correspondingly drenched with rain.<a
  id="NtA_87" href="#Nt_87"><sup>[87]</sup></a> This rite also illustrates the origin of a
  conception which has its roots in sympathetic magic and yet exerts considerable influence in the
  civilised world&mdash;the conception of "legal fictions." The images, undoubtedly, were
  substitutes for human beings who were (as representing the corn-spirit) drowned in the Tiber.
  Human sacrifice, though exceptional, was not unknown at Rome in historic times, as appears from
  <i>R. Q.</i> 83; and the substitution of animals or of inanimate objects for human beings is not
  peculiar to Rome, but is the usual means by which the transition from the more to the less
  barbarous <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxiii">{lxxxiii}</span>custom is effected. But the
  Romans, who were practical and logical to the extreme, who reduced magic to a system whereby they
  regulated their daily life, consistently enough also utilised sympathetic magic as a legal
  instrument. For it would be a great mistake to infer from the ridicule poured by Cicero (<i>Pro
  Murena</i>, xii. 62) on the fictions of Roman law, that those symbolisms were puerile mummeries
  designed to benefit the legal profession at the expense of its clients. The clod of earth which
  was brought into court was no mere symbol, but gave to those who held it exactly the same control
  over the estate from which it came, as the image of a god gives to its possessor, or as the hair
  or clothing of a person who is to be bewitched gives to the worker of the spell.</p>

  <p>A form of sympathetic magic which is practised by agricultural peoples all over the world is a
  "sacred marriage," whereby two spirits or their images, or their living representatives, are
  united, in order that their union may be sympathetically followed by fertility in flock and field.
  The ceremony of the "sacred marriage" frequently survives when its purpose has been forgotten, and
  then a popular explanation is <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxiv">{lxxxiv}</span>invented for
  and by the folk. The myth of Acca Larentia, given by Plutarch, <i>R. Q.</i> 35, seems to me a
  piece of folk-lore of this kind. To begin with, it is not uncommon to find in Greek and Asiatic
  cults, for instance,<a id="NtA_88" href="#Nt_88"><sup>[88]</sup></a> a woman shut up with a god in
  his temple. And the result of this union is an increase in the agricultural wealth or fertility of
  the community. The same result appears in the "rationalised" explanation of the "sacred marriage"
  of Acca Larentia and Hercules, given by Plutarch. Further, an exactly similar tale is told of
  Hercules and Flora,<a id="NtA_89" href="#Nt_89"><sup>[89]</sup></a> whose name shows that she is a
  spirit of flowering and blossoming vegetation, whilst her cult points to a realistic sacred
  marriage in which she took part.<a id="NtA_90" href="#Nt_90"><sup>[90]</sup></a> Again, Acca
  Larentia and Flora were evidently felt to be spirits of the same class as the Dea Dia, for
  sacrifices were offered to them as part <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxv">{lxxxv}</span>of the
  worship of the Dea Dia; and the Dea Dia was a corn-spirit, as is plainly shown by the <i>Acta
  Arvalium Fratrum</i>.<a id="NtA_91" href="#Nt_91"><sup>[91]</sup></a> At the same time, though
  Acca Larentia, Flora, and the Dea Dia were all spirits of the same class, it is clear that they
  were distinguished from each other, for the Arval Brothers sacrificed to each of them separately
  and under distinct names. Finally, whether Acca Larentia had originally anything to do with the
  Lares seems doubtful,<a id="NtA_92" href="#Nt_92"><sup>[92]</sup></a> and in spite of the fact
  that, in later times at any rate, she was called "the mother of the Lares," one cannot build much
  on the etymology which makes "Acca" mean "mother."<a id="NtA_93" href="#Nt_93"><sup>[93]</sup></a>
  Certain it is, however, that the Arval Brothers, in worshipping the Dea Dia, began their famous
  and <span class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxvi">{lxxxvi}</span>very ancient song with an invocation of
  the Lares.<a id="NtA_94" href="#Nt_94"><sup>[94]</sup></a> It is plain, therefore, that there was
  from pre-historic times a tendency to associate the worship of the kindly Lares with that of
  spirits of the class to which the Dea Dia and Acca Larentia belonged. But the feast of the
  Larentalia (or Larentinalia), to which Plutarch alludes in <i>R. Q.</i> 34, was evidently a piece
  of ancestor-worship, and may therefore have been part of the worship of the Lares from the
  beginning. If this really be so, Acca Larentia will be a soul promoted to the rank of a spirit of
  vegetation.</p>

  <p>The theory of sympathetic magic may perhaps afford the solution of Plutarch's problem (97), why
  they that would live chaste were forbidden to eat pulse. Plutarch suggests that as far as beans
  are concerned the reason may be that the Pythagoreans abominated them. This "symbol" of the
  Pythagoreans is well-known. Milton was inspired by it to put the case&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <p style="margin-left:6.30em">"If all the world</p>
    <p>Should in a fit of temp'rance feed on pulse,"</p>
  </div>

  <p>and, according to Neanthes, quoted by <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagelxxxvii">{lxxxvii}</span>Iamblichus in his life of Pythagoras, the prohibition extended
  even to treading down the growing bean; for, he informs us, Pythagoras inculcated the virtue of
  chastity so successfully that when ten of his disciples, being attacked, might have escaped by
  crossing a bean-field, they died to a man rather than tread down the beans: and when another
  disciple, who was shortly afterwards captured and brought before Dionysius, was bidden by that
  tyrant to explain the strange conduct of his fellows, he replied, "They suffered themselves to be
  put to death rather than tread beans under foot; and I will rather tread beans under foot than
  reveal the reason."</p>

  <p>This is sufficiently mysterious; and the Pythagorean symbol can scarcely be said to explain the
  Italian prohibition. But though Plutarch has committed the error of defining <i>ignotum per
  ignotius</i>, he has nevertheless been led by a sound instinct, in comparing the two things
  together. Mr. Frazer (in <i>Folk-Lore</i>, i. 145 <i>ff.</i>) has abundantly shown that many of
  the symbols of Pythagoras are but maxims of folk-lore which have gathered round the name of that
  mysterious philosopher. It would be nothing strange, then, if a piece of Italian <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxviii">{lxxxviii}</span>folklore should be fathered on Pythagoras, for
  Magna Graecia was the home of Pythagoreanism.</p>

  <p>Now the folk has at all times been fond of discovering resemblances between plants and other
  objects, as the common names of flowers, &amp;c., sufficiently show. Further, according to popular
  notions, these resemblances do not exist for nothing: between the plant and the object it
  resembles there exists an occult but potent relation. The "Doctrine of Signatures" was a
  quasi-scientific organisation of this branch of folk-lore. "Turmeric has a brilliant yellow
  colour, which indicates that it has the power of curing jaundice; for the same reason, poppies
  must relieve diseases of the head," to take a couple of instances from the <i>Pharmacologia</i> of
  Dr. Paris (p. 43). The ancient Romans who substituted an offering of poppy-heads for a sacrifice
  of human beings were not practising a childish cheat on the gods: on all sound principles of
  folk-lore they were offering a perfectly valid equivalent.</p>

  <p>When then we find Porphyry, in his life of Pythagoras (§ 43), saying that Pythagoras bade his
  followers "abstain from beans as from human flesh," we may reasonably infer that <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagelxxxix">{lxxxix}</span>beans were regarded, in the folk-lore of the day,
  as resembling some part of the human body, and as having a mysterious affinity with it. This
  conjecture receives some support from the fact that, whereas Porphyry explains all the other
  "symbols" as allegorical statements of various moral and civic duties, he explains this by a piece
  of folk-lore of the same kind as the modern popular belief that a hair kept in water will turn
  into an eel. The exact part of the body to which beans were supposed to bear a resemblance may be
  difficult at this distance of time to determine. The passage in Porphyry gives some hints.<a
  id="NtA_95" href="#Nt_95"><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

  <p>A more interesting fact is that, according to Herodotus, ii. 37, the Egyptians had the same
  aversion to eating beans, and that Egyptian priests might not even look at a bean, so unclean
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagexc">{xc}</span>was it considered. From this passage it is usually
  inferred that Pythagoras obtained this piece of his doctrine from the Egyptians; and V. D. Link
  (<i>Die Urwelt</i>, 225) sought to support the inference by the suggestion that the prohibition
  originally had reference to the sacred Egyptian bean, and was subsequently extended to the common
  bean (<i>faba vulgaris</i>). Pursuing this line of thought, we are at once struck by the fact that
  the sacred Egyptian bean (<i>nelumbium speciosum</i>) is a lotus; and the lotus, both as a plant
  and as a symbol,<a id="NtA_96" href="#Nt_96"><sup>[96]</sup></a> carries our thoughts to India. We
  thus seem to see a piece of folk-lore migrating, along with the plant to which it was attached,
  from India to Egypt, from Egypt to Europe.</p>

  <p>But when did this interesting migration take place? The prohibition was known pretty early in
  Sicily, for it makes its appearance in the fragments of Empedocles, who was born at Agrigentum,
  <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 490. We can, however, trace it back much earlier in Italy. There
  it dates from pre-historic times, for it was one of the taboos laid upon the flamen Dialis. And
  the <span class="pagenum" id="pagexci">{xci}</span>idea that beans were human flesh is implied in
  the part which they played in the funeral ceremonies of the primitive Italians. That part is
  remarkably interesting. Plutarch tells us that "the solemne suppers and bankets at funerals for
  the dead were usually served with pulse above all other viands." This is a strange contrast to the
  aversion shown otherwise for eating beans, and it cries aloud for explanation.</p>

  <p>Mr. E. S. Hartland, in <i>Folk Lore</i>, III. ii., has put forward the theory that the practice
  of sin-eating is the transformed survival of a savage custom of eating deceased kinsmen. Even
  those who dissent from his conclusion will not be able to deny that the custom does exist among
  savages, and that the object of cannibalism is to secure to the eater the courage, cunning,
  strength, &amp;c., of the person eaten; nor will it be denied that on the first movement from
  savagery a tendency would manifest itself to substitute for the corpse anything which, according
  to the canons of savage logic, might be regarded as an equivalent substitute. The Italians,
  regarding beans as human flesh, might, we may conjecture, substitute beans; as the Bavarian
  peasant substitutes <i>Leichen-nudeln</i>. Before, however, we can <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexcii">{xcii}</span>regard this as anything more than a guess, we want proof that the
  Italians did really look upon the beans which they ate at funeral feasts as representative of the
  deceased. That proof is forthcoming, I submit, in the belief mentioned by Pliny (<i>N. H.</i>,
  xviii. 30. 2) that "the spirit of the deceased was in the bean" (<i>mortuorum animæ sint in
  ea</i>, <i>i.e.</i>, in the <i>faba</i>). And inasmuch as the law forbade them that would be
  chaste to eat pulse, it seems probable that the object of eating beans at funeral banquets was to
  convey the propagating powers of the deceased to his kinsmen.</p>

  <p>If then the superstition about the bean was borrowed by the Italians, it must have been
  borrowed in primitive times; and we must think that the belief reached the Italians at the same
  time as the cultivation of the bean itself spread from its original (unknown) home. But, if we may
  trust comparative philology, the bean was probably known to the European Aryans before they
  divided into separate peoples, such as Slavs, Italians, &amp;c. And thus we can catch glimpses of
  this piece of folk-lore on its travels in pro-ethnic times. But this, I confess, I find it rather
  hard to believe. Of course, if there <span class="pagenum" id="pagexciii">{xciii}</span>were
  channels of communication by which the plant itself could travel in that "time long past," then by
  those same channels the superstition might be conveyed. But on the other hand, if one people could
  see a resemblance between the bean and some part of the human body, so might another. We do not
  imagine that because some of the taboos laid on the Mikado were the same as some laid on the
  flamen Dialis, they were therefore borrowed. Why, then, should we resort to the hypothesis of
  borrowing to account for the fact the flamen of pre-historic times was forbidden, exactly in the
  same way as the priests of ancient Egypt, to see or name a bean?</p>

  <p>Folk-lorists will naturally inquire whether any traces of the conceptions and customs we have
  been examining can be found in fairy-tales.</p>

  <p class="sp3">I may therefore conclude by pointing out that in a Lithuanian tale, published and
  translated into German in the <i>Litauische Volkslieder und Märchen</i> of A. Leskien and K.
  Brugman (p. 202 and p. 471), the bean has the same "signature" as it had in ancient Italy. Another
  story in the same collection (pp. 363-371 and 490-494) should also be noticed here: a maiden is
  given <span class="pagenum" id="pagexciv">{xciv}</span>the heart of a dead man to eat, and two
  hours afterwards she bore a son, who could speak and run the moment he was born.</p>

  <p class="ac">XI. <span class="sc">Aryan Marriage.</span></p>

  <p>In the <i>Romane Questions</i><a id="NtA_97" href="#Nt_97"><sup>[97]</sup></a> Plutarch has
  preserved for us various marriage customs, which raise the whole question, not perhaps of human
  marriage, but certainly of Aryan marriage. Has monandry always been the prevailing form among the
  Aryan-speaking peoples? Among those peoples has the family, as far as we can see or guess, from
  the beginning been patriarchal and agnatic?</p>

  <p>As a starting-point for the discussion of this question, two propositions may be laid down as
  broadly true. The first is, that at some period or other, all Aryans have been in the habit of
  obtaining their wives (or some of their wives) by capture and by purchase. This fact may
  ultimately imply scarcity of native women, female infanticide, polyandry, and kinship through the
  female line; or it may prove to be perfectly compatible with a patriarchal and <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexcv">{xcv}</span>agnatic system. But it is a fact, and a fact of the first
  importance for this discussion. The second proposition that may safely be made is, that in
  historical times at least, the patriarchal form of family has always been the prevailing form
  amongst Aryan nations. The exceptions may be real, or they may be due to faulty observation; they
  may be of the highest importance, as being the sole indications of a prior and very different form
  of family life, or they may be merely local, transient departures from the normal patriarchal
  form, and so be insignificant or deceptive; but in any case, they are relatively so few as to
  leave it a practically true statement to say that the patriarchal family has been normal among the
  Aryans in historic times.</p>

  <p>The evidence of the existence of marriage by capture is furnished by folk-lore. It is not
  necessary, nor is this the place to review that evidence; but the survivals of this form of
  marriage which are recorded in the <i>Romane Questions</i> must be mentioned. The Romans, Plutarch
  says (<i>R. Q.</i>, 29), "<i>would not permit the new wedded bride to passe of herself over the
  door-sill or threshold, when she is brought home to <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexcvi">{xcvi}</span>her husband's house, but they that accompanie her must lift her up
  between them from the ground, and so convey her in</i>."<a id="NtA_98"
  href="#Nt_98"><sup>[98]</sup></a> That the Romans themselves were dimly conscious of the real
  origin of this custom is implied in the first solution suggested by Plutarch, viz., that the
  ceremony was "in remembrance of those first wives whom they ravished perforce from the Sabines;"
  and Rossbach, in his great work on Roman marriage,<a id="NtA_99" href="#Nt_99"><sup>[99]</sup></a>
  sees in the custom a survival from times when the bride, captured by force, was conveyed against
  her will into the house (or den) of her captor. Parallels to the Roman custom are to be found
  elsewhere. Among the modern Greeks the bride is lifted over the threshold, as it would be most
  unlucky if she touched it in crossing.<a id="NtA_100" href="#Nt_100"><sup>[100]</sup></a> It is
  the most important wedding-guest among the Servians,<a id="NtA_101"
  href="#Nt_101"><sup>[101]</sup></a> the bride's nearest relation in Lorraine,<a id="NtA_102"
  href="#Nt_102"><sup>[102]</sup></a> who carries her in his arms from the waggon into her new home.
  Among the North Frisians the <span class="pagenum" id="pagexcvii">{xcvii}</span>"bride-lifter"
  (<i>bridlefstr</i>) is a regular wedding-official.<a id="NtA_103"
  href="#Nt_103"><sup>[103]</sup></a> The ceremony seems to have been known to the ancient Hindoos
  also.<a id="NtA_104" href="#Nt_104"><sup>[104]</sup></a> The Finnish-Ugrians, whether they
  borrowed or lent, or independently developed the custom, uniformly practise it.<a id="NtA_105"
  href="#Nt_105"><sup>[105]</sup></a> It is further noteworthy that the Finnish-Ugrians agree with
  the Romans, the Hindoos, and the Russians in this, viz., that the bride is not only carried over
  the threshold by some of the bridal party (not by the bridegroom) but is then caused by them "to
  sit upon a fliece of wooll."<a id="NtA_106" href="#Nt_106"><sup>[106]</sup></a> The meaning and
  object of this strange proceeding were quite unknown to the Romans, who practised it in Plutarch's
  time, as they are to the Finnish-Ugrians and Russians who still observe the custom. Rossbach
  rightly compares the ancient Roman custom of making the <i>flamen</i> and <i>flaminica</i>, when
  married <i>per farreationem</i>, sit upon the fleece of the sheep that was slaughtered during the
  wedding ceremonies;<a id="NtA_107" href="#Nt_107"><sup>[107]</sup></a> he then refers to the <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagexcviii">{xcviii}</span>Roman practice of sitting for a short time after
  prayer in silent meditation, and this he thinks explains the custom in question. But surely it
  leaves unexplained just that which requires explanation. Granted, that the Romans showed more
  reverence than, say the Scots whom Dr. Boyd can remember; still, are we to imagine them so rapt
  into "the mind's internal heaven" that they could sit down in the grease and the gore of a
  freshly-slaughtered sheep's fell, "nor heed nor see what things these be"? Why did they not sit
  down somewhere else?</p>

  <p>A possible answer to this question may be found in the following considerations. Many savages
  consider themselves peculiarly liable on their wedding-day to the attacks of evil spirits. The
  Hindoos and the Finnish-Ugrians unanimously regard the seating of the bride on the fleece as the
  right time for exorcising evil spirits and purifying the bride: the Hindoos recite an incantation,
  the Esthonians clash daggers over her head, for iron is generally dreaded by spirits. It is,
  therefore, an easy inference that the fleece itself had purificatory powers; and, as a matter of
  fact, we find that the Greeks, at any rate, regarded a sheepskin <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagexcix">{xcix}</span>in this light, for in the preliminary ceremonies of the Eleusinia was a
  purificatory rite which was known as the Zeus-fleece.<a id="NtA_108"
  href="#Nt_108"><sup>[108]</sup></a> In the collection of the Hôtel Lambert<a id="NtA_109"
  href="#Nt_109"><sup>[109]</sup></a> is a red-figured vase bearing a representation of this rite,
  in which the person purified is represented as crouching on the fleece.</p>

  <p>In days when marriage by capture was real, and not merely symbolical, it was highly important
  that a strange woman should, immediately on entering the house, be, so to speak, spiritually
  disinfected, lest she should introduce unwelcome spirits into her new home; or, in the intimate
  relations which were to subsist between her and her captor,<a id="NtA_110"
  href="#Nt_110"><sup>[110]</sup></a> should bring him into the power of strange and hostile gods.
  Hence the close adhesion of the ceremony of the fleece, <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagec">{c}</span>long after its meaning was forgotten, to that of lifting the bride over the
  threshold.</p>

  <p>But it was necessary not merely to detach the strange woman from her own gods, she must also be
  introduced to the gods of her new home. This introduction survived in the Roman custom, whereby
  <i>new wedded wives are bidden to touch fire and water</i> (<i>R. Q.</i> 1).<a id="NtA_111"
  href="#Nt_111"><sup>[111]</sup></a> That this custom goes back to the time when wives were
  captured is indicated by the words "are bidden:" the force which was at first necessarily used
  survives in this gentle compulsion. Parallels to this custom are forthcoming: the Hindoo bride,
  according to the Kâuçikasûtra (77. 16), was led thrice round the hearth in the bridegroom's house.
  Exactly the same ceremony not only was practised by the ancient Teutons, but is still observed in
  some places in North Germany and in Westphalia.<a id="NtA_112" href="#Nt_112"><sup>[112]</sup></a>
  The Esthonians and Wotjaks still honour the custom.<a id="NtA_113"
  href="#Nt_113"><sup>[113]</sup></a> The first thing a Servian <span class="pagenum"
  id="pageci">{ci}</span>bride has to do on entering her new home is to mend the fire,<a
  id="NtA_114" href="#Nt_114"><sup>[114]</sup></a> and in ancient Greece she was taken at once to
  the hearth. It need hardly be said that the hearth is the abode of the house-spirit and the centre
  of the family worship. At Rome, we find from Festus,<a id="NtA_115"
  href="#Nt_115"><sup>[115]</sup></a> the bride was also sprinkled with water. In Sardinia,<a
  id="NtA_116" href="#Nt_116"><sup>[116]</sup></a> her mother-in-law empties a glass of water over
  her. Amongst the ancient Hindoos<a id="NtA_117" href="#Nt_117"><sup>[117]</sup></a> this was the
  bridegroom's duty; with the Servians it is the function of the <i>Djewer</i>.<a id="NtA_118"
  href="#Nt_118"><sup>[118]</sup></a> That this sprinkling was originally an introduction of the
  strange woman to the local water-spirit seems indicated by the fact that amongst the Servians the
  sprinkling is performed at the well, in the Unterkrain at the burn,<a id="NtA_119"
  href="#Nt_119"><sup>[119]</sup></a> in Albania<a id="NtA_120" href="#Nt_120"><sup>[120]</sup></a>
  at the village-spring, while in modern Greece the bride casts offerings into the spring.<a
  id="NtA_121" href="#Nt_121"><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The conventionally extravagant lamentation which was required of the Roman bride<a id="NtA_122"
  href="#Nt_122"><sup>[122]</sup></a> is <span class="pagenum" id="pagecii">{cii}</span>regarded by
  Rossbach (p. 329) as a survival of marriage by capture, and may be paralleled amongst many Aryan
  nations: with the Hindoos it was part of the officially prescribed programme;<a id="NtA_123"
  href="#Nt_123"><sup>[123]</sup></a> in the Oberpfalz it is obligatory; in Bohemia and in Russia it
  is required by public opinion.<a id="NtA_124" href="#Nt_124"><sup>[124]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The evidence of folk-lore (so far as it is called for by the <i>Romane Questions</i>) that the
  Aryans obtained wives by capturing the women of other households or family groups than their own,
  has now been stated. It does not suffice to show that an Aryan was forbidden to marry a woman of
  his own household; but a wider survey of early Aryan wedding-customs would bring out this
  important fact, that however other parts of the ceremony vary, there is one which is always
  present, and which may be regarded as essential&mdash;that is the <i>domum deductio</i>, the
  bringing-home of the bride; and from this fact we may fairly draw the conclusion that normally,
  and&mdash;so strong is custom&mdash;probably uniformly, the bride and the bridegroom belonged to
  different households, and that the bride came to live in the home of the bridegroom.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pageciii">{ciii}</span></div>

  <p>Marriage by purchase does not happen to be mentioned in the <i>Romane Questions</i>, nor is it
  necessary to prove what is universally admitted. All that need be remarked here is that purchase
  was not necessarily preceded by a state of things in which capture prevailed; frequently it may
  have been a peaceable remedy for the grievances caused by capture, but quite as often it may have
  been practised side by side with capture from the beginning. Further, the purchase, like the
  capture, of wives implies that husband and wife belonged to different households; and purchase
  indicates that the wife thus bought was the property of the husband, or at least that she was
  subject to him.</p>

  <p>Let us now turn to the evidence showing that the family was patriarchal and agnatic. The
  evidence is furnished by the comparative study of law, especially the law regulating the order in
  which the relatives of a dead man shall succeed to his property. The order of succession
  prescribed by the earliest legal codes is strikingly similar among all the Aryan peoples; first,
  the deceased's male descendants to the third generation (his sons, grandsons, and
  great-grandsons); next, the male descendants of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pageciv">{civ}</span>deceased's father to the third generation (<i>i.e.</i>, the deceased's
  brothers, nephews, and grand-nephews); then the male descendants of the deceased's grandfather to
  the third generation (<i>i.e.</i>, his uncles, cousins, and their children); and finally, the male
  descendants of his great-grandfather to the third generation (<i>i.e.</i>, his great-uncles, his
  first cousins once removed, and his second cousins once removed). Beyond these degrees, kin was
  not counted; and if no heir were forthcoming within them, the property went, amongst the Hindoos,
  to those of the same name as the deceased; amongst the Romans, to the members of his <i>gens</i>;
  in Crete, to the village community. What is the origin of this unanimous and well-marked
  distinction between the Near and the Remote Kin? Why were the <i>anchisteis</i>, "the nearest
  relations," as the Greeks technically named them, so sharply distinguished from the others?</p>

  <p>To begin with, it is clear that the distinction, being common to all the Aryans, was not
  developed subsequently to their dispersion, but is pre-historic&mdash;indeed, pro-ethnic. Hence it
  follows that the distinction was not the work of any legislator or of any individual; it could not
  <span class="pagenum" id="pagecv">{cv}</span>have been a law enacted by a lawgiver and enforced by
  the State under pains and penalties, for the simple reason that the Aryans, previous to their
  dispersion, were not organised into a State, and had no government to issue or execute laws. But
  before Law, Custom was, and "Kin and Custom go together and imply each other, as do Law and State.
  Law is the enactment of the State&mdash;Custom is the habit of the Kin. And as Custom precedes
  Law, so the State is preceded by kin or sib associations. The earliest form of the State is
  modelled on that of the sib associations out of which it is developed, and the first laws
  promulgated by the State are but the old customs committed to writing."<a id="NtA_125"
  href="#Nt_125"><sup>[125]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In what pro-ethnic Aryan custom, then, are we to seek the origin of the clear and deep-cut line
  between the Near and the Remote Kin? The answer is furnished by what is known among the Slavonians
  as the house community, and to Anglo-Indian lawyers as "the joint undivided family." As it exists
  now in India, the joint undivided family consists, or may <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecvi">{cvi}</span>consist, of the sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons of a man (deceased),
  who, on the death of their common ancestor, do not separate, but continue to live on the undivided
  estate and worship their deceased ancestor as their house-spirit. The family, as defined by the
  Judicial Committee of the Privy Council,<a id="NtA_126" href="#Nt_126"><sup>[126]</sup></a> is
  "joint in food, worship, and estate."</p>

  <p>Now, the relatives whom the earliest Aryan codes, the laws of the Twelve Tables, the laws of
  Solon, of Menu, the Gortyn Code, &amp;c., specify as a man's heirs-at-law are in every case
  precisely those relatives who belonged, or might at some time have belonged, to the same joint
  undivided family as the deceased. It is worth while to note that at different times a man might
  belong to four different joint undivided families: he might be born into a family which still
  united in worshipping the spirit of his great-grandfather: and thus his cousins, his first cousins
  once removed, and his second cousins once removed, would dwell in the same household with him. His
  grandfather might then die and become a house-spirit: in that event, his grand-uncle (and
  descendants) would have <span class="pagenum" id="pagecvii">{cvii}</span>to set up a family of his
  own, for they only can belong to a joint undivided family who are descended from a common
  house-father. Now, my grand-uncle, being the brother of my grandfather, is not descended from my
  grandfather, therefore cannot worship his spirit, therefore cannot belong to the joint undivided
  family which worships my grandfather's spirit. On the other hand, the family, of which my
  (deceased) grandfather is the house-spirit, includes my grandfather's descendants to the third
  generation, <i>i.e.</i>, includes not only my cousins, but also their sons. This (cousins' sons)
  is the limit of the second joint undivided family to which it is possible for a man to belong.
  Thirdly, when my father becomes a house-spirit, and is worshipped by his children's children, I
  dwell in the same household as my nephews and grand-nephews. Finally, when I am gathered to my
  fathers, I dwell, in the spirit, with my sons, grandsons, and great-grandsons.</p>

  <p>Here we obviously have the key to the order of succession prescribed by the earliest Aryan
  codes: my own descendants (if any) are called first, because they constitute the joint undivided
  family, with which, at the time of <span class="pagenum" id="pagecviii">{cviii}</span>dying, I am
  presumably dwelling. My father's descendants come next, because that was the family I had
  previously belonged to; and on the same principle my grandfather's descendants, and then those of
  my great-grandfather were called.</p>

  <p>So long as the joint undivided family was a living institution, so long there was no need (as
  there was no thought) of specifying who a man's heirs were, and so long a man could be in no doubt
  as to who his Near Kin were&mdash;they were those who had been brought up in the same family as
  himself. It was only when this unwieldy form of family came to be disintegrated by the advance of
  civilisation that it became necessary to specify the order of succession, and to determine who
  were a man's Near Kin; and, as we have seen, the earliest laws on this subject are but the old
  customs reduced to writing.</p>

  <p>Two facts of importance in the history of Aryan marriage have now been shown. The first,
  inferred from the <i>domum deductio</i> and from the existence of marriage by capture and by
  purchase, is that amongst the undispersed Aryans a man customarily abstained from marrying a woman
  belonging to his own family group. <span class="pagenum" id="pagecix">{cix}</span>The second is
  that the family groups in which the Aryans lived, if not originally, certainly for some time
  before their dispersion, were joint undivided families. The Aryan was averse to marrying women of
  his Near Kin; the difficult question now arises, whether he was equally averse to marrying into
  his Remote Kin? The "prohibited degrees" of historic times do not help us much in answering this
  question. The Athenians had lost the Aryan aversion to marriages within the near kin: they married
  their cousins, and even half-sisters. There is no evidence to show that the Romans ever abstained
  from marrying their Remote Kin. Rossbach maintains that the prohibition extended only to first
  cousins; Klenze, Walter, Burchardy, Göttling, and Gerlach make it go as far as the extreme limit
  of the Near Kin, <i>i.e.</i>, to second cousins once removed&mdash;no writer on Roman law or
  marriage supports a wider prohibition; and the <i>jus osculi</i><a id="NtA_127"
  href="#Nt_127"><sup>[127]</sup></a> (which, by the way, was accorded by men to men as well as by
  women to men) extended only to the near kin. The Hindoos, again, were averse to marriage between
  any persons of the same name.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagecx">{cx}</span></div>

  <p>Does the Hindoo system come down from pro-ethnic times, or is it a development peculiar among
  Aryan nations to the Hindoos? Many savages have a much wider circle of prohibited degrees than
  civilised peoples possess, and amongst civilised peoples themselves the number of prohibited
  degrees has even in historic times diminished. We thus seem to get a sort of law of diminishing
  degrees, which would point to the Hindoo system as that which was known to the pro-ethnic Aryans.
  But though some savages have more prohibited degrees than civilised men have, other savages have
  few or none. The downward movement, therefore, from the maximum to the minimum number of
  prohibited degrees which is observable in historic times must have been preceded in pre-historic
  ages by an upward movement from the minimum to the maximum; and, as far as the evidence at present
  goes, though the upward movement may, in pro-ethnic times, have proceeded as far as the Remote
  Kin, it may equally well only have reached to the limits of the Near Kin; while, after the Aryan
  dispersion, the movement may have continued upwards amongst the Hindoos, downwards amongst the
  Athenians, <span class="pagenum" id="pagecxi">{cxi}</span>and, for a long time, have ceased to
  move in any direction amongst the conservative Romans.</p>

  <p>A more important point to notice is that, if we believe the Hindoo system to date from
  pro-ethnic times, we must also assume that the Hindoo system of naming is pro-ethnic, <i>i.e.</i>,
  we must assume that each Aryan had two names, one distinguishing him personally from other people,
  the other indicating what kin he belonged to; and in this event, the Near and the Remote Kin must,
  in pro-ethnic times, have had a common name. There is, however, very little evidence to show that
  this was the case: gentile names are found among the Hindoos and the Romans alone of Aryan
  peoples. It is, of course, possible that, before the dispersion, the Aryans had gentile names, and
  that, after the dispersion, all the Aryans, with the exception of the Romans and the Hindoos, lost
  them entirely. On the other hand, if there was a time when gentile names had not yet been
  invented, if they have had a history and growth, we must consider it as at least possible that
  gentile names had not been evolved at the time of the dispersion, and were only developed
  subsequently by the Romans and Hindoos.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagecxii">{cxii}</span></div>

  <p>Whether the undispersed Aryans had gentile names, and at the same time an aversion to marriages
  between persons of the same name, is a question on which it were vain to pronounce confidently. We
  may more safely consider both these equally possible alternatives, together with the consequences
  which flow from each. Let us assume that marriage was, amongst the Aryans as amongst the Hindoos,
  prohibited between persons of the same gentile name: is there anything in the social organisation
  presupposed by this prohibition incompatible with the patriarchal system? According to Mr. D.
  M&lsquo;Lennan there is: not only are there "numerous societies of which the patriarchal theory
  does not even attempt to give any account," but "in the societies upon contemplation of which it
  was formed, a most serious difficulty for it is presented by the tribes, which consist of several
  clans, each clan considered separate in blood from all the others. The patriarchal theory, of
  course, involves that the clans are all of the same blood."<a id="NtA_128"
  href="#Nt_128"><sup>[128]</sup></a> Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan's difficulty seems to be this: where
  inheritance (of family name, property, sacra, &amp;c.) is confined to the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxiii">{cxiii}</span>male line, the descendants of a common ancestor must all have the
  same family or gentile name; persons having different names cannot be descended from the same
  ancestor&mdash;that is to say, different <i>gentes</i> or clans cannot have a common origin. A
  tribe, therefore, which consists of several clans cannot consist of descendants of a common
  ancestor. Yet, these clans believe they have an ancestor, however remote, in common. If their
  belief is incorrect (if the <i>gentes</i> have not a common origin), how did the error arise? If,
  on the other hand, the different <i>gentes</i> of the same tribe have a common origin, how came
  they to have different names?</p>

  <p>The source of this difficulty plainly is the assumption that the original ancestor of the tribe
  had a family name, which was inherited by all his descendants. It is impossible to disprove or to
  prove this assumption. We may, however, note that the Teutons (according to Dr. Taylor<a
  id="NtA_129" href="#Nt_129"><sup>[129]</sup></a>) rejoiced in only one name a-piece. An Athenian
  added to his own name his father's. And&mdash;to set assumption against assumption&mdash;we may
  conjecture that as patronymics are formed from personal names, so gentile names <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagecxiv">{cxiv}</span>were developed out of patronymics. At first, a man's
  sons bore nothing in their names to indicate from what father they were sprung. In course of time
  the sons of Anchises were known as Anchisiadæ; and as long as the family group consisted only of
  parents and children, this system of nomenclature would suffice. It might even continue into times
  when the family group included three generations: Iulus, as well as his father, Æneas, might be an
  Anchisiades. And here we may note that if all the members of a joint undivided family bore the
  surname Anchisiades, an aversion to marriage in the near kin would forbid the marriage of any two
  Anchisiadæ. When, however, owing to natural growth, the joint undivided family of Anchises becomes
  so large that it is necessary for his younger (married) sons to go out into the world and start
  joint undivided families of their own, leaving Æneas and his children in possession of the old
  home, it is obvious that persons who once had belonged to the same joint undivided family, and
  therefore had possessed the same family name, and had been prohibited to intermarry, would now
  belong to different families, <span class="pagenum" id="pagecxv">{cxv}</span>and (being named
  after the respective house-fathers of the newly formed families) would have different patronymics,
  and would be allowed to marry persons whom previously they were forbidden to wed. In these
  circumstances an extension both of prohibited degrees and of the family name might very naturally
  be the ultimate result. Iulus, who for years had worshipped Anchises as house-spirit, and had
  consequently been an Anchisiades, might, when Æneas became his house-spirit, come to be known as
  an Ænæades, but on the other hand the old patronymic might stick to him and to his children for
  ever. In the same way, the aversion to marrying women who belonged to the same joint undivided
  family might cease when they ceased to belong to the same family, but it might continue. Hence a
  continual tendency to extend the family name, and to enlarge the number of prohibited degrees.</p>

  <p>The transition from the system of naming by patronymics to that of gentile names would not be
  made in a day or in a generation, and during the transition the usage would fluctuate: the
  descendants of Æneas might choose to be known as Ænæadæ rather than as the sons of Anchises, <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagecxvi">{cxvi}</span>while the children of Æneas' brothers might retain the
  name of Anchisiadæ, because their fathers were less distinguished than their grandfather. The
  period of this fluctuation in usage may be assumed to have been long enough to allow of the
  requisite diversity of gentile names, while the fact that the number of <i>gentes</i> is always
  fixed, however far back they can be historically traced, shows that the fluctuation at last
  hardened into unyielding custom.</p>

  <p>It was pointed out in the last paragraph but one that second cousins once removed (the
  great-grandchildren of a common house-father) might at one time belong to the same joint undivided
  family, and subsequently to different families, and that they might wish to continue, after their
  separation, to consider each other as relatives. Language afforded them no means of indicating
  their relationship, for there was no word in the original Aryan language for "cousin," much less
  for "second cousin." And before patronymics had been stereotyped into gentile names, it might seem
  that the Aryan system of naming at that time afforded no means of binding these relatives together
  either. But a certain Athenian custom may perhaps be taken, both <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxvii">{cxvii}</span>as evidence of the existence of the desire in question, and as an
  indication of the means taken for gratifying it. At Athens it was the custom to name a child after
  its grandfather; and if we assume this practice to have obtained in Aryan times, we have here a
  ready means for indicating the fact that second cousins are related without the aid of a gentile
  name; for if I and my first cousin are both named after our common grandfather, then our children
  (who are second cousins once removed) will have the same patronymic, and therefore will be
  related, and thence again prohibited to marry. This may be illustrated by an imaginary pedigree,
  which will also serve to show how&mdash;when once patronymics, such as "John's son," became
  stereotyped into true family or gentile names, such as "Johnson"&mdash;all the <i>gentes</i> of a
  tribe might be descended from a common ancestor. Thus<span class="wnw">:&mdash;</span></p>

  <p>We may now sum up. The oldest form of family organisation historically traceable amongst the
  Aryans is that of the joint undivided family. The pro-ethnic Aryans were probably averse to
  marriages between members of the same joint undivided family. They may also have been averse to
  marriages between second cousins once removed, even when those second cousins had ceased to dwell
  in the same joint household. If so, then, as language afforded no term even for "cousins," the
  memory of the relationship may have been kept up in one of three ways. As the members of a
  <i>genos</i> at Athens had no common family name, and as they were notoriously related, not by
  blood, but merely by the possession of a joint-worship, so amongst the Aryans a joint-worship may
  have served as the mark of kinship (as it does among the Hindoos still). Or the remote kin may
  have been enabled to claim kindred by means of a patronymic system, which survived at Athens. Or,
  third, gentile names may have been developed out of patronymics even in pro-ethnic times, in which
  case marriage would be prohibited, as amongst the Hindoos, between all persons of the same family
  name.</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="pagecxx">{cxx}</span></div>

  <p>But there is nothing in this patriarchal organisation of the family and of the tribe which
  compels us to assume that it was evolved out of some earlier non-patriarchal form of family. The
  warrant for such an assumption, if to be found, must be sought elsewhere. Let us seek. Analogy
  will not help us. The patriarchal system may, elsewhere in the world, have been evolved out of the
  matriarchate; but, as the late Mr. M&lsquo;Lennan warned us, we may not assume that marriage has
  everywhere had the same history. The widest survey of the various forms of human marriage
  (Westermarck's) that has yet been made warrants no presumption in favour of the priority of the
  matriarchate. If the matriarchate was a pro-ethnic Aryan institution, it is on Aryan ground that
  traces of it must be discovered. Such traces are said to be discernible.</p>

  <p>There are traces amongst some Aryan peoples of the levirate. The levirate is said to indicate
  polyandry, and polyandry to presuppose the matriarchate. This is a perfectly legitimate line of
  argument, but before resorting to polyandry for an explanation of the Aryan levirate, it is worth
  while to inquire whether there is <span class="pagenum" id="pagecxxi">{cxxi}</span>anything in
  known Aryan customs capable of supplying an explanation. According to Aryan custom, the estate of
  a man who leaves no son passes to the next of kin, <i>i.e.</i>, his brother, or it may be a more
  distant relative. If the deceased leaves no son, but a daughter, then according to Athenian law,
  according to the Gortyn Code, and probably also according to Aryan custom, the next of kin
  (whether brother or not) must not only take the estate, but also marry the heiress, if any
  (whether wife or daughter of the deceased). According to the Gortyn Code, if the next of kin is
  married, he must put away his wife; if the heiress is already married, she must leave her husband.
  Now, if the obligation to raise up seed to the deceased extended only to his brothers, the Tibetan
  form of polyandry would afford an explanation which, whether correct or not, would, at any rate,
  account for all the facts. But inasmuch as the obligation is binding on all the near kin, and
  extends to the daughter as well as the wife of the deceased, it cannot be explained by the
  hypothesis of the Tibetan form of polyandry or any other form short of incest in every degree
  possible, not only amongst the members of the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxxii">{cxxii}</span>same joint undivided family, but also with the women who have married
  out of that family into some other. In truth, so far from <i>mutterrecht</i> being the source of
  the Aryan custom, that custom bears on its face the marks of the rudest and most savage
  application of the agnatic theory. The provisions of the Gortyn Code which require that the next
  of kin shall marry the heiress, even if the marriage necessitate divorce on both sides, show that
  the mother was held absolutely incapable of transmitting rights&mdash;only a kinsman could do
  that. A devotion to the principle of agnation so strong as to over-ride the innate Aryan aversion
  to endogamous marriages, so strong even in the days of civilised Athens as to afford the Orestes
  of Æschylus with the defence that the mother whom he had killed was not of his blood, cannot be
  explained as a survival from times when kinship was counted exclusively through the female line.
  The savage practice must have its roots in some equally crude and savage theory. What the Aryan
  theory was we can hardly hope to discover, but we may conjecture that it was at least as barbarous
  as that which leads savages to eat their dead kinsmen, and European <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxxiii">{cxxiii}</span>peasants to eat corpse-cakes, in the belief that thereby "the
  virtues and advantages of the departed ... and the living strength of the deceased passed over ...
  into the kinsman who consumed them, and so were retained within the kindred" (Mr. E. S. Hartland
  in <i>Folk Lore</i>, III. ii. 149). The <i>Leichen-nudeln</i> of the Bavarian peasant, or the
  beans of the primitive Italian funeral feasts, would, when eaten, qualify the next of kin to wed
  the heiress and to raise up seed to the dead kinsman.</p>

  <p>Before leaving the subject of the levirate we may note that the joint undivided family survived
  in historic times at Athens and in Sparta, and that in both places brothers lived on the
  joint-estate as well after the death as during the life of their father. In Sparta, if one only of
  the brothers had a son, that son was naturally heir to the joint-estate, and was considered the
  son of all. Amongst the Hindoos, too, Vasishtha says (xvii. 10), "If amongst many brothers who are
  begotten by one father, one have a son, they all have offspring through that son" (<i>cf.</i>
  Vishnu, xv. 42).<a id="NtA_130" href="#Nt_130"><sup>[130]</sup></a> Now, a casual <span
  class="pagenum" id="pagecxxiv">{cxxiv}</span>observer, ignorant of the nature and constitution of
  the joint undivided family, might thus easily draw the mistaken inference that the wife of one
  brother was common to them all; and this may be the origin of Cæsar's statement with regard to the
  polyandry of the ancient Britons, and of Polybius' with regard to the Spartans. Or, again, it is
  possible that the joint undivided family may in these instances have given rise to this form of
  polyandry. It is thus not safe to infer that where polyandry is, the matriarchate must previously
  have been.</p>

  <p>There remains the argument from totems. Unfortunately their very existence in Europe is
  questioned, and this is not the place to discuss the question. It is safer not to meddle in
  European totems at present. Their appearance in Greek mythology, however, may fittingly here be
  made the subject of a brief allusion. The value, to the anthropologist, of ancient Roman customs
  and beliefs is that they show us the Italians at a much lower stage of civilisation than that in
  which the Vedas show us the Hindoos or the Homeric poems the Greeks. They show us an Aryan people
  having no mythology, and they warrant the inference that <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxxv">{cxxv}</span>myths were unknown to the pro-ethnic Aryans. The Greek myths about the
  amours of Zeus in animal form cannot go back, therefore, to Aryan times. They may be the peculiar
  invention of the early Greeks, or it may be that the families which claimed to be descended from
  animals were pre-Hellenic, and that, when they joined the immigrating Greeks, they learnt the
  worship of Zeus, and were aided in their conversion by identifying Zeus with their animal
  ancestor.</p>

  <p>Against the instances of polyandry and the survivals of totemism, which may or may not show
  that the matriarchate was known to Aryan peoples, we may fairly set the evidence of comparative
  philology. The original Aryan language possessed terms for grandfather, father, son, and grandson;
  and these are just the direct ascendants and descendants who could compose a joint undivided
  family. There was a word for the paternal uncle, whom the children brought up in such a family
  would know; there is none for the maternal uncle, with whom they would not dwell. There were
  special designations for husband's father, husband's mother, husband's brother, husband's sister,
  and even for husband's brothers' wives&mdash;just the words which would <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxxvi">{cxxvi}</span>be required if the wife left her own family to dwell in that of her
  husband. There were none for wife's father, mother, &amp;c., which would be required if the
  husband became a member of his wife's family. And this&mdash;which is inconsistent with the
  matriarchal system&mdash;is in accord with the evidence afforded by wedding customs, viz., that
  the wife left father and mother, and was brought, by the <i>domum deductio</i>, to her husband's
  home.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Still, it would be as unjustifiable to say that the matriarchate could never have
  established itself on Aryan ground, as it is to say that the agnatic family must have been
  developed out of the system of "maternal rights" and "female descent." The list of prohibited
  degrees varies among early Aryan peoples from the minimum possible for a civilised people (as at
  Athens) to the maximum possible even for savages (as amongst the Hindoos). There may have been a
  similar variation in the organisation of the family. Nor can we say with confidence that the
  pro-ethnic Aryans were more uniform than their descendants. The different languages evolved out of
  the common Aryan tongue existed as dialects from the beginning, and in the <span class="pagenum"
  id="pagecxxvii">{cxxvii}</span>beginning there may have been differences in social organisation.
  But whereas we can certainly trace the joint undivided family and the principle of agnation as far
  back as modern science enables us to trace the Aryans at all, the evidence for the existence of
  the matriarchate at any time amongst any Aryan people is inferior both in amount and in value.</p>

  <p class="ac">XII. <span class="sc">Conclusion.</span></p>

  <p>After writing a hundred pages as though one knew something, it is a relief to confess one's
  ignorance. So I shall do myself the pleasure of concluding with a list of Romane Questions which
  are too hard for me. Why <i>they kept the temple of the goddesse Horta open alwaies</i> I own to
  me is a mystery yet. I cannot even conjecture <i>what is the reason that Quintus Metellus forbad
  to observe auspices after the moneth Sextilis</i>, nor why <i>they thought Aruspices ought to have
  their lanterns and lampes alwaies open</i>, nor why <i>obsserve they the vultures most of any
  other fowles in taking of presages</i>. White, as a mourning colour, which is prescribed in <i>R.
  Q.</i> 26, may be paralleled in <span class="pagenum" id="pagecxxviii">{cxxviii}</span>the customs
  of Gambreion, in Asia Minor, and in Argos, but the explanation is beyond me. The origin of the
  proverb <i>Sardi venales</i>, and of the interesting custom associated with it (<i>R. Q.</i> 53),
  can scarcely be said to be explained either by Festus (p. 322) or by Cicero (VII. <i>Fam.</i>,
  24). Nor do I know why boys were named on the ninth, whereas girls were named on the eighth day of
  birth. And <i>why</i> did the Romans of old time invariably, when they went out to supper, take
  with them <i>their young sonnes</i>, <i>even when they were but in their very infancie and
  childhood</i>?</p>

  <p class="sp3"><span class="sc">May</span> it not be, that this is respective to the remembrance

  which grew to be exceeding faire and woonderfull bigge withall above any other: and a certeine
  wizard or soothsaier came unto him and said: How predestined it was that the citie which
  sacrificed that cow unto <i>Diana</i> in the mount <i>Aventine</i>, should become most puissant
  and rule all <i>Italy</i>: This <i>Coratius</i> therefore came to <i>Rome</i> of a deliberate
  purpose to sacrifice the said cow accordingly: but a certaine houshold servant that he had, gave
  notice secretly unto king <i>Servius Tullius</i> of this prediction delivered by the abovesaid
  soothsaier: whereupon <i>Servius</i> acquainted the priest of <i>Diana</i>, <i>Cornelius</i>, with
  the matter: and therefore when <i>Antion</i> <i>Coratius</i> presented himselfe for to performe
  his sacrifice, <i>Cornelius</i> advertised him, first to goe downe into the river, there to wash;
  for that the custome and maner of those that sacrificed was so to doe: now whiles <i>Antion</i>
  was gone to wash himselfe in the river, <i>Servius</i> steps into his place, prevented his
  returne, sacrificed the cow unto the goddesse, and nailed up the hornes when he <span

  this historie, and <i>Varro</i> likewise, saving that <i>Varro</i> expressely setteth not downe

    house?</i></p>
  </div>

  <p><i>Varro</i> rendreth a reason heereof, which I take to be altogether fabulous: for hee
  writeth, that during the Silician warre, there was a great battell fought upon the sea, and
  immediately upon it, there ranne a rumour of many that they were dead in this fight; who

  advertised and taught him how he should from the roofe of the house let himselfe downe by a rope,
  and so get in: now when he had so done, he became fortunate ever after, all the rest of his life;
  and hee lived to be a very aged man: and heereof arose the foresaid custome, which alwaies
  afterwards was kept and observed.</p>

  <p>But haply this fashion may seeme in some sort to have beene derived from the Greeks: for in
  <i>Greece</i> they thought not those pure and cleane who had beene caried foorth for dead to be
  enterred; or whose sepulchre and funerals were solemnized or prepared: neither were such allowed
  to frequent the company of others, nor suffred to come neere unto their sacrifices. And there
  goeth a report of a certaine man named <i>Aristinus</i>, one of those who had beene possessed with
  this superstition, how he sent unto the oracle of <i>Apollo</i> at <i>Delphos</i>, for to make
  <span class="pagenum" id="page10">{10}</span>supplication and praier unto the god, for to bee

  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Is</span> it as most men thinke, for that women being forbidden to drinke
  wine, the manner was brought up: That whensoever they met their kinsfolke, they should kisse their
  lips, to the end they might not be unknowen, but convicted if they had drunke wine? or rather for
  another reason, which <i>Aristotle</i> the philosopher hath <span class="pagenum"
  id="page12">{12}</span>alledged? for as touching that occasion, which is so famous and commonly
  voiced in every mans mouth, yea, and reported of divers and sundrie places; it was no doubt the
  hardy attempt executed by the dames of <i>Troie</i>, and that upon the coasts of <i>Italy</i>; for
  when the men upon their arrivall were landed; the women in the meanewhile set fire upon their
  ships, for very desire that they had to see an end once, one way or other of their long voiage,
  &amp; to be delivered frõ their tedious travel at sea: but fearing the fury of their men, when
  they should returne, they went forth to meet their kinsfolke and friends upon the way, and
  welcomed them with amiable embracing &amp; sweet kisses of their lips: by which means having
  appeased their angrie mood, and recovered their favours, they continued ever after, the custome of
  kind greeting and loving salutation in this manner.</p>

  <p>Or was not this a priviledge granted unto women for their greater honour and credit; namely, to
  be knowen and seen for to have many of their race and kinred, and those of good worth and
  reputation?</p>

  <div><span class="pagenum" id="page13">{13}</span></div>

  <p class="sp3">Or because it was not lawfull to espouse women of their blood and kinred, therefore
  permitted they were to entertaine them kindly and familiarly with a kisse, so they proceeded no
  farther; insomuch as this was the onely marke and token left of their consanguinitie. For before
  time, they might not marrie women of their owne blood; no more than in these daies their aunts by
  the mothers side, or their sisters: and long it was ere men were permitted to contract marriage
  with their cousin germains; and that upon such an occasion as this. There was a certaine man of
  poore estate and small living, howbeit otherwise of good and honest cariage, and of all others
  that managed the publike affairs of State most popular and gracious with the commons: who was
  supposed to keepe as his espoused wife a kinswoman of his and cousin germain, an inheritresse; by
  whom he had great wealth, and became verie rich: for which he was accused judicially before the
  people; but upon a speciall favour that they bare unto him, they would not enquire into the cause
  in question; but not onely suppressed his bill of <span class="pagenum"
  id="page14">{14}</span>enditement, and let her go as quit of all crime, but also even they,
  enacted a statute; by vertue whereof, lawfull it was for all men from that time forward to marrie,

  necessitie, as forcing and constraining the will; and likewise pleasure, as deceiving the

  head, and so performed his sacrifice; there is good reason and consequence, that if men be covered
  before their enemies, they should be bare when they encounter either their friends, or men of
  woorth and honour: for this maner of being covered before the gods, is not properly respective
  unto them, but occasioned by accident, and hath, since that example of <i>Aeneas</i>, beene
  observed and continued.</p>

  <p>But if we must say somewhat else beside, consider whether it be not sufficient to enquire <span

  when they worship the gods, seeing the other consequently dependeth heereupon: for they stand bare

  diminish their envie, for feare they might be thought to require as much reverence and the same
  honor as is exhibited to the gods, or suffer themselves, and take pleasure to bee observed and
  reverenced equally with them: as for the gods they adored them after this sort; either by way of
  lowlinesse and humbling themselves before their majestie, in covering and hiding their heads; or
  rather because they feared lest as they made their praiers, there should come unto their hearing,
  from without, any sinister voice or inauspicate and ominous osse: and to prevent such an object
  they drew their hood over their eares: And how true it is that they had a carefull eie and regard
  to meet with all such accidents, it may appeere by this, that when they went to any oracle for to
  be resolved by answer from thence upon a scrupulous doubt, they caused a great noise to <span

  collect by many other conjectures, and by this specially, that the fift moneth in order after
  March was called <i>Quintilis</i>, and the sixt moneth <i>Sextilis</i>, and all the rest
  consequently one after another until you come to the last, which they named December, because it
  was the tenth in number after March: which giveth occasion unto some for to thinke <span

  accomplished their compleat yeere, not in twelve moneths but in ten: namely, by adding unto everie
  one of those ten moneths certain daies over and above thirtie. Others write, that December indeed
  was the tenth moneth after March; but Januarie was the eleventh, and Februarie the twelfth: in
  which moneth they used certaine expiatorie and purgatorie sacrifices, yea, and offered oblations
  unto the dead (as it were) to make an end of the yere. Howbeit afterwards they transposed this
  order, and ranged Januarie in the first place, for that upon the first day thereof, which they
  call the Calends of Januarie; the first Consuls that ever bare rule in <i>Rome</i> were enstalled,
  immediatly upon the deposition and expulsion of the kings out of the citie. But there seemeth to
  be more probability &amp; likelihood of truth in their speech, who say, that <i>Romulus</i> being
  a martiall prince, and one that loved warre and feats of armes, as being reputed the sonne of
  <i>Mars</i>, set before all other moneths, that which caried the name of his father: howbeit
  <i>Numa</i> who <span class="pagenum" id="page30">{30}</span>succeeded next after him, being a man
  of peace, and who endevored to withdraw the hearts and minds of his subjects and citizens from
  warre to agriculture, gave the prerogative of the first place unto Januarie, and honoured
  <i>Janus</i> most, as one who had beene more given to politick government, and to the husbandrie
  of ground, than to the exercise of warre and armes.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Consider moreover, whether <i>Numa</i> chose not this moneth for to begin the yeere
  withall, as best sorting with nature in regard of us; for otherwise in generall, there is no one
  thing of all those that by nature turne about circularly, that can be said first or last, but
  according to the severall institutions and ordinances of men, some begin the time at this point,
  others at that. And verely they that make the Winter solstice or hibernall Tropick the beginning
  of their yeere, do the best of all others: for that the Sunne ceasing then to passe farther,
  beginneth to returne and take his way againe toward us: for it seemeth, that both according to the
  course of nature, and also in regard of us, this season is most befitting to begin the yeere: for

  <p class="sp3">Or peradventure, seeing their maner is to consecrate unto every god one kinde of

  and hardy bird, having a bill so strong, that he is able to overthrow an oke therewith, after he
  hath jobbed and pecked into it as farre as to the very marrow and heart thereof.</p>

  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Is</span> it because as many thinke, and as <i>Titus Livius</i> hath recorded
  in his storie; the Tribunes <span class="pagenum" id="page38">{38}</span>militarie, at what time
  as they had consular and soveraigne authoritie, went into the field with the Romane armie the
  morrow after the <i>Ides</i> of the moneth <i>Quintilis</i>, which was the same that July now is,
  and were discomfited in a battell by the Gaules, neere unto the river <i>Allia</i>: and
  cõsequently upon that overthrow, lost the very city it selfe of <i>Rome</i>: by which occasion the
  morrow after the <i>Ides</i>, being held and reputed for a sinister and unluckie day; superstition
  entring into mens heads, proceeded farther (as she loveth alwaies so to doe) and brought in the
  custome for to hold the morrow after the <i>Nones</i>, yea, and the morrow after the
  <i>Calends</i>, as unfortunate, and to be as religiously observed in semblable cases.</p>

  <p>But against this there may be opposed many objections: for first and formost, they lost that
  battell upon another day, and calling it <i>Alliensis</i>, by the name of the river <i>Allia</i>,
  where it was strucken, they have it in abomination for that cause. Againe, whereas there be many
  daies reputed dismal and unfortunate, they doe not observe so precisely and with so religious
  feare, <span class="pagenum" id="page39">{39}</span>other daies of like denomination in every
  moneth, but ech day apart onely in that moneth wherein such and such a disaster, hapned: and that
  the infortunitie of one day should draw a superstitious feare simply upon all the morrowes after
  <i>Calends</i>, <i>Nones</i>, and <i>Ides</i>, carieth no congruitie at all, nor apparence of
  reason.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Consider moreover and see, whether, as of moneths they used to consecrate the first
  to the gods celestiall; the second to the terrestriall, or infernall, wherein they performe
  certeine expiatorie ceremonies and sacrifices of purification, and presenting  offirings and
  services to the dead: so of the daies in the moneth, those which are chiefe and principall, as
  hath beene said, they would not have to be kept as sacred and festivall holidaies; but such as
  follow after, as being dedicated unto the spirits, called <i>Dæmons</i>, and those that are
  departed; they also have esteemed cõsequently as unhappy, &amp; altogether unmeet either for to
  execute or to take in hand any businesse: for the Greeks adoring and serving the gods upon their
  new moones and first daies of the moneth, have attributed the second daies <span class="pagenum"
  id="page40">{40}</span>unto the demi-gods and <i>Dæmons</i>: like as at their feasts also they
  drinke the second cup unto their demi-gods, and demi-goddesses. In summe, Time is a kinde of
  number, and the beginning of number is (I wot not what,) some divine thing, for it is Unitie: and
  that which commeth next after it is Deuz or two, cleane opposite unto the said beginning, and is
  the first of all even numbers: as for the even number it is defective, unperfect, and indefinit,
  whereas contrariwise, the uneven or odde number it selfe is finite, complet, and absolute: and for
  this cause like as the <i>Nones</i> succeed the <i>Calends</i> five daies after; so the
  <i>Ides</i> follow the <i>Nones</i> nine daies after them; for the uneven and odde numbers doe
  determine those beginnings, or principall daies; but those which presently ensue after the said
  principall daies being even, are neither ranged in any order, nor have power and puissance: and
  therefore men doe not enterprise any great worke, nor set foorth voiage or journey upon such
  daies: and heereto wee may to good purpose annex that pretie speech of <i>Themistocles</i>: For
  when the morrow (quoth he) upon a time quarrelled with <span class="pagenum"
  id="page41">{41}</span>the festivall day which went next before it, saying, that herselfe was
  busied and tooke a great deale of pains, preparing &amp; providing with much travel those goods
  which the feast enjoied at her ease, with all repose, rest, and leisure: the Festivall day made
  this answer: Thou saidst true indeed; but if I were not, where wouldst thou be? This tale
  <i>Themistocles</i> devised, and delivered unto the Athenian captaines, who came after him; giving
  them thereby to understand, that neither they nor any acts of theirs would ever have beene seene,
  unlesse hee before them had saved the citie of Athens. Forasmuch then, as every enterprise and
  voiage of importance hath need of provision, and some preparatives; and for that the Romans in old
  time upon their festivall daies, dispensed nothing, nor took care for any provision; being wholy
  given and devoted at such times to the service &amp; worship of God, doing that, and nothing else;
  like as even yet at this day, when the priests begin to sacrifice, they pronounce with a loud
  voice before all the companie there assembled <span class="sc">Hoc age</span>, that is to say,
  Minde this, and doe no other thing: <span class="pagenum" id="page42">{42}</span>verie like it is,
  and standeth to great reason, that they used not to put themselves upon the way for any long
  voiage, nor tooke in hand any great affaire or businesse presently after a festivall day, but kept
  within house all the morrow after, to thinke upon their occasions, and to provide all things
  necessarie for journey or exploit: or we may conjecture, that as at this very day the Romans after
  they have adored the gods, and made their praiers unto them within their temples, are woont to
  stay there a time, and sit them downe; even so they thought it not reasonable to cast their great
  affaires so, as that they should immediately follow upon any of their festivall daies; but they
  allowed some respit and time betweene, as knowing full well, that businesses carie with them
  alwaies many troubles and hinderances, beyond the opinion, expectation, and will of those who take
  them in hand.</p>

  obscuritie: and therefore there is no colour els but white, which is pure, unmixt, and not stained

  agreeable unto those who are interred, considering that the dead is now become simple, pure,

  the earth be fully gathered and laid up.</p>

  <p>Or haply, for that the husband men began at this time to breake up their grounds against their

  <p>Or haply, because this moneth is dedicate and consecrated by the Romans to <i>Saturne</i>; for
  they counted <i>Saturne</i> one of the gods beneath, and none of them above: and withall,
  considering the greatest and most solemne feast, which they call <i>Saturnalia</i>, is holden in
  this moneth, at what time as they seeme to have their most frequent meeting, and make best cheere,

  another <i>Acca Larentia</i>, the nurse of <i>Romulus</i>, unto whom they do honour in the moneth
  of Aprill. As for this courtizan <i>Larentia</i>, she was (as men say) surnamed <i>Fabula</i>, and
  came to be so famous and renowmed by such an occasion as this. A certeine sexton of
  <i>Hercules</i> his temple, having little els to doe, and <span class="pagenum"
  id="page57">{57}</span>living at ease (as commonly such fellowes doe) used for the most part to
  spend all the day in playing at dice and with cokall bones: and one day above the rest, it
  fortuned, that meeting with none of his mates and play-fellowes who were woont to beare him
  company at such games, and not knowing what to do nor how to passe the time away, he thought with
  himselfe to challenge the god whose servant he was, to play at dice with him, upon these
  conditions: That if himselfe woon the game, <i>Hercules</i> should be a meanes for him of some
  good lucke and happy fortune; but in case he lost the game, he should provide for <i>Hercules</i>
  a good supper, and withall, a pretie wench and a faire, to be his bedfellow: these conditions
  being agreed upon and set downe, he cast the dice, one chance for himselfe, and another for the
  god; but his hap was to be the loser: whereupon minding to stand unto his challenge, and to
  accomplish that which he had promised, he prepared a rich supper for <i>Hercules</i> his god, and
  withall, sent for this <i>Acca Larentia</i>, a professed courtisan and common harlot, whom he
  feasted <span class="pagenum" id="page58">{58}</span>also with him, and after supper bestowed her
  in a bed within the very temple, shut the doores fast upon, and so went his way. Now the tale goes
  forsooth, that in the night, <i>Hercules</i> companied with her, not after the maner of men, but
  charged her, that the next morning betimes she should go into the market-place, and looke what man
  she first met withall, him she should enterteine in all kindnesse, and make her friend especially.
  Then <i>Larentia</i> gat up betimes in the morning accordingly, and chanced to encounter a
  certeine rich man and a stale bacheler, who was now past his middle age, and his name was
  <i>Taruntius</i>; with him she became so familiarly acquainted, that so long as he lived, she had
  the command of his whole house; and at his death, was by his last will and testament instituted
  inheritresse of all that he had. This <i>Larentia</i> likewise afterward departed this life, and
  left all her riches unto the citie of <i>Rome</i>: whereupon this honour abovesaid was done unto

  <p class="sp3">Or rather, like as it was thought a great sinne and exceeding irreverence, for a
  man to turne himselfe out of his apparrell naked, in any church, chappell, or religious and sacred
  place; even so they carried a great respect unto the aire and open skie, as being full of gods,
  demi-gods, and saints. And this is the verie cause, why we doe many of our necessarie businesses
  within doores, enclosed and covered with the roofe of our houses, and so remooved from the <span

  be that by law are commaunded and enjoined unto the priest onely; and others againe unto all men,
  by the priest: as for example, heere with us in <i>B&#x0153;otia</i>; to be crowned with chaplets
  of flowers upon the head; to let the haire grow long; to weare a sword, and not to set foot within
  the limits of <i>Phocis</i>, pertaine all to the office and dutie of the captaine generall and
  chiefe ruler: but to tast of no new fruits before the Autumnall Aequinox be past; nor to cut and
  prune a vine but before the Aequinox of the Spring, be intimated and declared unto all by the said
  ruler or captaine generall: for those be the verie seasons to do both the one &amp; the other. In
  like case, it should seeme in my judgement that among the Romans it properly belonged to the
  priest; not to mount on horseback; not to be above three nights out of the citie; not to put off
  his cap, whereupon he was called in the Roman language, <i>Flamen</i>. But there be many other
  offices and duties, notified and declared unto all men by the priest, among which this is one,
  <span class="pagenum" id="page66">{66}</span>not to be enhuiled or anointed abroad in the open
  aire: For this manner of anointing drie without the bath, the Romans mightily suspected and were
  afraid of: and even at this day they are of opinion, that there was no such cause in the world
  that brought the Greeks under the yoke of servitude and bondage, and made them so tender and
  effeminate, as their halles and publike places where their yong men wrestled &amp; exercised their
  bodies naked: as being the meanes that brought into their cities, much losse of time, engendred
  idlenesse, bred lazie slouth, and ministred occasion &amp; opportunity of lewdnesse and vilany; as
  namely, to make love unto faire boies, and to spoile and marre the bodies of young men with
  sleeping, with walking at a certeine measure, with stirring according to motions, keeping
  artificiall compasse, and with observing rules of exquisit diet. Through which fashions, they see
  not, how (ere they be aware) they be fallen from exercises of armes, and have cleane forgotten all

  conceited pleasants, and <span class="pagenum" id="page67">{67}</span>faire minions, than hardie
  footmen, or valiant men of armes. And verely it is an hard matter to avoid and decline these

  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Is</span> it not, for that they (to speak properly) are no magistrates? for in
  truth they have no ushers or vergers to carie before them the knitches of rods, which are the
  ensignes of magistracie; neither sit they in the chaire of estate called <i>Sella curulis</i>, to
  determine causes judicially, or give audience unto the people; nor enter into the administration
  of their office at the beginning of the yeere, as all other magistrates doe: neither are they put
  downe and deposed after the election of a Dictatour: but whereas the full power and authoritie of
  all other magistrates <span class="pagenum" id="page121">{121}</span>of State, he transferred from
  them upon himselfe: the Tribunes onely of the people continue still, and surcease not to execute
  their function, as having another place and degree by themselves in the common-weale: and like as
  some oratours and lawiers doe hold, that exception in law is no action, considering it doth cleane
  contrary to action; for that action intendeth, commenseth, and beginneth a processe or sute; but
  exception or inhibition, dissolveth, undooeth, and abolisheth the same: semblably, they thinke
  also, that the Tribunate was an empeachment, inhibition, and restraint of a magistracie, rather
  than a magistracie it selfe: for all the authority and power of the Tribune, lay in opposing
  himselfe, and eroding the jurisdiction of other magistrates, and in diminishing or repressing
  their excessive and licentious power.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Or haply all these reasons and such like, are but words, and devised imaginations
  to mainteine discourse: but to say a trueth, this Tribuneship having taken originally the first
  beginning from the common people, is great and mighty in regard that it is popular; and that the
  Tribunes <span class="pagenum" id="page122">{122}</span>themselves are not proud nor highly
  conceited of themselves above others, but equall in apparell, in port, fare, and maner of life, to
  any other citizens of the common sort: for the dignity of pompe and outward shew, apperteineth to
  a Consull or a Prætour: as for the Tribune of the people, he ought to be humble and lowly, and as
  <i>M. Curio</i> was woont to say; ready to put his hand under every mans foot; not to carie a
  loftie, grave, and stately countenance, nor to bee hard of accesse, nor strange to be spoken with,
  or dealt withall by the multitude; but howsoever he behave himselfe to others, he ought to the
  simple and common people, above the rest, for to be affable, gentle, and tractable: and heereupon
  the maner is, that the dore of his house should never be kept shut, but stand open both day and
  night, as a safe harbour, sure haven, and place of refuge, for all those who are distressed and in
  need: and verilie the more submisse that he is in outward appeerance, the more groweth hee and
  encreaseth in puissance; for they repute him as a strong hold for common recourse and retrait,
  unto al comers, no lesse than <span class="pagenum" id="page123">{123}</span>an altar or
  priviledged sanctuary. Moreover, as touching the honour that he holdeth by his place, they count

  <p class="sp3">Or was it not for that they thought those people, who did it by a law or custome,
  offended highly: but they themselves were directed thereto by expresse commaundement out of the
  bookes of <i>Sibylla</i>. For reported it is, that one of their votaries or Vestall nunnes named
  <i>Helbia</i>, riding on horse-backe, was smitten by a thunderbolt or blast of lightning; and that
  the horse was found lying along all bare bellied, and her selfe likewise naked, with her smocke
  and petticote turned up above her privie parts, as if she had done it of purpose: her shooes, her
  rings, her coife and head attire cast here and there apart from other things, and withall lilling
  the toong out of her head. This strange occurrent, the soothsayers out of their learning
  interpreted to signifie, that some great shame did betide the sacred virgins, that should be
  divulged and notoriously knowen; yea, and that the same infamie should reach also as far, as unto
  some of the degree of gentlemen or knights of <i>Rome</i>. Upon this there was a servant <span

  detected three Vestal virgins to have at one time forfeited their honor, &amp; been naught of
  their bodies, to wit, <i>Aemilia</i>, <i>Licinia</i>, &amp; <i>Martia</i>; and that they had
  companied too familiarly with men a long time; and one of their names was <i>Eutetius</i>, a
  Barbarian knight, and master to the said enformer. So these vestall Votaries were punished after
  they had beene convicted by order of law, and found guiltie: but after that this seemed a fearfull
  and horrible accident: ordeined it was by the Senate, that the priests should peruse over the
  bookes of <i>Sibyllaes</i> prophesies, wherein were found (by report) those very oracles which
  denounced and foretold this strange occurrent, and that it portended some great losse and
  calamitie unto the common-wealth: for the avoiding and diverting whereof, they gave commaundement
  to abandon unto (I wot not what) maligne and divelish strange spirits, two Greekes, and two
  Galatians likewise; and so by burying them quicke in that verie place, to procure propitiation at

  <p>Or because the execution of desseignes, howsoever it begin at the sunne rising; yet the

  making of a van.</p>

  <p>Or haply, for that like as we see, that many men at noone make an end of their businesse of
  great importance, and of State affaires; even so, they supposed that they were to begin the same
  at mid-night. For better proofe whereof a man may frame an argument hereupon, that the Roman
  chiefe ruler never made league, nor <span class="pagenum" id="page128">{128}</span>concluded any
  capitulations and covenants of peace after mid-day.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Or rather this may be, because it is not possible to set downe determinately, the
  beginning and end of the day, by the rising and setting of the sunne: for if we do as the vulgar
  sort, who distinguish day and night by the sight and view of eie, taking the day then to begin
  when the sunne ariseth; and the night likewise to begin when the sunne is gone downe, and hidden
  under our horizon, we shall never have the just Aequinox, that is to say, the day and night
  equall: for even that verie night which we shall esteeme most equall to the day, will proove
  shorter than the day, by as much as the body or biggenesse of the sunne containeth. Againe, if we
  doe as the Mathematicians, who to remedie this absurditie and inconvenience, set downe the
  confines and limits of day and night, at the verie instant point when the sunne seemeth to touch
  the circle of the horizon with his center; this were to overthrow all evidence: for fall out it
  will, that while there is a great part of the sunnes light yet under the earth (although the <span
  class="pagenum" id="page129">{129}</span>sunne do shine upon us) we will not confesse that it is
  day, but say, that it is night still. Seeing then it is so hard a matter to make the beginning of
  day and night, at the rising or going downe of the sunne, for the absurdities abovesaid, it
  remaineth that of necessitie we take the beginning of the day to be, when the sunne is in the mids
  of the heaven above head, or under our feet, that is to say, either noon-tide or mid-night. But of
  twaine, better it is to begin when he is in the middle point under us, which is just midnight, for
  that he returneth then toward us into the East; whereas contrariwise after mid-day he goeth from
  us Westward.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">May</span> there not be a naturall reason rendred hereof, that they should
  impose the names <span class="pagenum" id="page151">{151}</span>sooner upon daughters than sonnes:
  for that females grow apace, are quickly ripe, and come betimes unto their perfection in

  the seventh: for that the seventh day after children be borne is very dangerous, as well for other

  upon the seventh day, and so long as it continueth so resolved and open, an infant resembleth a
  plant rather than any animall creature?</p>

  <p>Or like as the Pythagoreans were of opinion, that of numbers the even was female and the odde,
  male; for that it is generative, and is more strong than the even number, because it is compound:
  and if a man divide these numbers into unities, the even number sheweth a void place betweene,

  and not easily removed. Heereunto we must adjoyne thus much more also, that eight is a number

  <p class="sp3">But surely this <i>Spurius</i>, is one of the ordinary fore-names that the Romans
  take, such as <i>Sextus</i>, <i>Decimus</i>, and <i>Caius</i>. Now these fore-names they never use
  to write out at full with all their letters, but marke them sometime with one letter alone, as for

  with twaine, as <i>Spurius</i> and <i>Cneus</i>, with <i>Sp.</i> and <i>Cn.</i> or at most with
  three as <i>Sextus</i> &amp; <i>Servius</i>, with <i>Sex.</i> and <i>Ser.</i> <i>Spurius</i> then
  is one of their fore-names which is noted with two letters <i>S.</i> and <i>P.</i> which
  signifieth asmuch, as <i>Sine Patre</i>, that is to say, without a father; for <i>S.</i> standeth
  for <i>Sine</i>, that is to say, without; and <i>P.</i> for <i>patre</i>, that is to say a father.
  And heereupon grew the error, for that <i>Sine patre</i>, and <i>Spurius</i> be written both with
  the same letters short, <i>Sp.</i> And yet I will not sticke to give you another reason, though it
  be somewhat fabulous, and carieth a greater absurdity with it: forsooth they say that the Sabines
  in olde time named in their language <span class="pagenum" id="page154">{154}</span>the nature or

  the house, not at the doore, but flung over the verie roofe thereof.</p>

  <p class="sp3">But to what purpose served all this, and what good would this have done, that he
  should shew himselfe so gentle, so affable, and humane, if he had a curst dog about him to keepe
  his doore, and to affright, chase and scarre all those away who had recourse unto him for succour.
  And yet so it is, that our ancients reputed not a dog to be altogether a clean creature: for first
  and formost we doe not find that he is consecrated or dedicated unto any of the celestial gods;
  but being sent unto terrestrial &amp; infernall <i>Proserpina</i> into the quarrefires and crosse
  high waies to make her a supper, he seemeth to serve for an expiatorie sacrifice to divert and
  turne away some calamitie, or to cleanse some filthie ordure, rather than otherwise: to say
  nothing, that in <i>Lacedæmon</i>, they cut and slit dogs down along the mids, and so sacrifice
  them to <i>Mars</i> <span class="pagenum" id="page165">{165}</span>the most bloody god of all
  others. And the Romanes themselves upon the feast <i>Lupercalia</i>, which they celebrate in the
  lustrall moneth of Purification, called February, offer up a dog for a sacrifice: and therefore it
  is no absurditie to thinke, that those who have taken upon them to serve the most soveraigne and
  purest god of all others, were not without good cause forbidden to have a dog with them in the
  house, nor to be acqainted and familiar with him.</p>

    <p class="sp0"><i>For what cause was not the same priest of</i> Jupiter <i>permitted, either to
    touch an ivie tree, or to passe thorow a way covered over head with a vine growing to a tree,
    and spreading her branches from it</i>?</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Is</span> not this like unto these precepts of <i>Phythagoras</i>: Eat not
  your meat from a chaire: Sit not upon a measure called <i>Ch&#x0153;nix</i>: Neither step thou
  over a broome or <a id="NtA_149" href="#Nt_149"><sup>[149]</sup></a>besoome. For <span
  class="pagenum" id="page166">{166}</span>surely none of the Pythagoreans feared any of these
  things, or made scruple to doe, as these words in outward shew, and in their litterall sense do
  pretend: but under such speeches they did covertly and figuratively forbid somewhat else: even so
  this precept: Go not under a vine, is to be referred unto wine, and implieth this much; that it is
  not lawfull for the said Priest to be drunke; for such as over drinke themselves, have the wine
  above their heads, and under it they are depressed and weighed downe, whereas men and priests
  especially ought to be evermore superiors and commanders of this pleasure, and in no wise to be
  subject unto it. And thus much of the vine.</p>

  <p>As for the ivie, is it not for that it is a plant that beareth no fruit, nor any thing good for
  mans use: and moreover is so weake, as by reason of that feeblenesse it is not able to sustaine it
  selfe, but had need of other trees to support and beare it up: and besides, with the coole shadowe
  that it yeelds, and the greene leaves alwaies to be seene, it dazeleth, and as it were bewitcheth
  the eies of many that looke <span class="pagenum" id="page167">{167}</span>upon it: for which
  causes, men thought that they ought not to nourish or entertaine it about an house, because it
  bringeth no profit; nor suffer it to claspe about any thing, considering it is so hurtfull unto
  plants that admit it to creepe upon them, whiles it sticketh fast in the ground: and therefore
  banished it is from the temples and sacrifices of the celestiall gods, and their priests are
  debarred from using it: neither shall a man ever see in the sacrifices or divine worship of
  <i>Juno</i> at <i>Athens</i>, nor of <i>Venus</i> at <i>Thebes</i>, any wilde ivie brought out of
  the woods. Mary at the sacrifices and services of <i>Bacchus</i>, which are performed in the night
  and darknesse, it is used.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Or may not this be a covert and figurative prohibition, of such blind dances and
  fooleries in the night, as these be, which are practised by the priests of <i>Bacchus</i>? for
  those women which are transported with these furious motions of <i>Bacchus</i>, runne immediately
  upon the ivie, and catching it in their hands, plucke it in pieces, or else chew it betweene their
  teeth; in so much as they speake not altogether absurdly, <span class="pagenum"
  id="page168">{168}</span>who say, that this ivie hath in it a certaine spirit that stirreth and
  mooveth to madnesse; turneth mens mindes to furie; driveth them to extasies; troubleth and
  tormenteth them; and in one word maketh them drunke withoute wine, and doth great pleasure unto
  them, who are otherwise disposed and enclined of themselves to such fanaticall ravishments of
  their wit and understanding.</p>

    <p class="sp0"><i>What is the reason that these Priests and Flamins of</i> Jupiter <i>were not
    allowed, either to take upon them, or to sue for any government of State, but in regard that
    they be not capable of such dignities, for honour sake and in some sort to make some recompense
    for that defect, they have an usher or verger before them carrying a knitch of rods, yea and a
    curall chaire of estate to sit upon</i>?</p>
  </div>

  <p><span class="sc">Is</span> it for the same cause, that as in some cities of <i>Greece</i>, the

  class="pagenum" id="page169">{169}</span>not chuse for their priests, meane persons and such as
  came next to hand.</p>

  <p>Or rather, because Priests having their functions determinate and certaine, and the kings,
  undeterminate and uncertaine, it was not possible, that when the occasions and times of both
  concurred together at one instant, one and the same person should be sufficient for both: for it
  could not otherwise be, but many times when both charges pressed upon him and urged him at ones,
  he should pretermit the one or the other, and by that meanes one while offend and fault in
  religion toward God, and anotherwhile do hurt unto citizens and subjects.</p>

  <p class="sp3">Or else, considering, that in governments among men, they saw that there was
  otherwhiles no lesse necessitie than authority; and that he who is to rule a people (as
  <i>Hippocrates</i> said of a physician, who seeth many evill things, yea and handleth many also)
  from the harmes of other men, reapeth griefe and sorrow of his owne: they thought it not in policy
  good, that any one should sacrifice unto the gods, or have the charge and superintendence of
  sacred things; <span class="pagenum" id="page170">{170}</span>who had been either present or

    from the Greek; that it is only in "a certain sense" that there can be said to be a Roman
    mythology; that it is a very different thing from Greek, Hindoo, Persian, Teutonic, and
    Scandinavian mythology; that the Romans had not advanced far in personifying and individualising
    their gods, and consequently could not develop much mythology. Finally, Italian religion was
    "far less widely removed" from the primitive Aryan belief than Greek religion and mythology
    were.</p>

    <p>We have no direct evidence of this, but we may infer it from the analogous case of Dius
    Fidius:&mdash;"Qui per Dium Fidium iurare vult, prodire solet in compluvium."&mdash;Non. Marc.,
    p. 494, quoting Varro. The temples of Dius Fidius had a hole specially made in the roof
    ("perforatum tectum," Varro, <i>L. L.</i> v. 66), under which one might swear. Probably the
    temples of Hercules were similarly provided; certainly those of Terminus were ("exiguum templi
    tecta foramen habent."&mdash;Ov. <i>F.</i> ii. 672).</p>

    <p>Reifferscheid, in the <i>Annali dell' Instituto</i> for 1867, p. 352 <i>ff.</i>, identifies
    Hercules with the <i>genius Jovis</i>. But, in the first place, this seems to me the wrong
    inference from his own facts, which all have exclusively to do with the <i>genii virorum</i>.
    Next, the <i>genius Jovis</i> is not known before <span class="smaller">B.C.</span> 58.
    Schwegler, before Reifferscheid, noticed that in Gellius, xi. 6. 1, "der römische Hercules

    <p>Roscher's arguments to show that Juno is the moon are not satisfactory. He assumes without
    proof that Juno was always Lucina (whereas Lucina was an independent spirit worshipped in woods,
    <i>Lexikon</i>, pp. 583 and 602), that Lucina was the moon (whereas she is the spirit that
    brings children to light, and is not = Luna), that the Italians connected the moon with
    child-birth (which, as Birt says, lacks proof), that the name <i>Juno</i> indicates a
    light-giving deity (whereas, though from the root *Div, it does not imply the giving of light
    any more than <i>deus</i> does, which is applied to the <i>di manes</i>, the <i>di
    indigetes</i>, <i>dea bona</i>, <i>dea dia</i>, &amp;c.). The arguments drawn by Roscher from
    works of art are untrustworthy, because borrowing is specially probable in their case. Finally,
    the hypothesis of a Græco-Italian period, on which Roscher relies to prove that Juno = Hera =
    the moon, is now discredited.</p>

    folk-lore explanation in a folk-etymology. "Ædem Dianæ dedicaverit in Aventino, cuius tutelæ
    sint cervi, a quo celeritate fugitivos vocent cervos" (Festus, p. 343<sup>a</sup>, 7, s.v.
    <i>Servorum dies</i>). Birt (Roscher's <i>Lexikon</i>, i. 1008) seems to take this explanation
    seriously; but the temple on the Aventine was precisely the temple in which the goddess of
    <i>cervi</i> was not worshipped. Possibly the right of asylum was conferred on the temple as
    part of the political changes brought about by the formation of the Latin confederacy, for this
    temple was the religious centre of the Latin alliance, "Commune Latinorum Dianæ templum" (Varro,
    <i>L. L.</i> v. 43). Hence, then, the folk-story that Servius Tullius, "natus servus" (Festus,
    <i>l.c.</i>), built the temple and gave it the right of asylum.</p>

    survive. For six weeks after delivery, the young mother is forbidden to enter a strange house,
    or go shopping, or draw water from a well, or walk over a sowed field (Grimm, <i>D.
    M.</i><sup>4</sup>, iii. pp. 435, 464, Nos. 35, 844, 845). The Esthonians also regard a new-born
    child as tabooed, and indirect contact with it as dangerous (<i>Ibid.</i>, p. 488, No. 28). For
    the death-dealing qualities of women, <i>cf.</i> Burchard von Worms, <i>Samlung der Decrete</i>,
    Coln, 1548, p. 201<i>a</i> (quoted by Grimm, iii. 410). Amongst the Eskimo, as amongst the
    Germans, the young mother is forbidden to leave the house for six weeks (Reclus, <i>Primitive
    Folk</i>, 36); she is also tabooed by the Badagas of the Neilgherrie Hills (<i>Ibid.</i>,

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
